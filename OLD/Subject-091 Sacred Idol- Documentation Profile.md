# Subject-091 "Sacred Idol" Documentation Profile

## Basic Classification

- **Category:** Benign (d4) - Predictable, easily contained
- **Threat Level:** Dormant (2 dice) - Passive, limited influence
- **Classification:** Thaumatological - Magically-enhanced, ritual-based

## Physical Description

Subject-091 presents as a life-sized marble statue depicting a Marble devotional figure with idealized dual anatomy. The figure stands approximately 1.8 meters in height with idealized human proportions enhanced by subtle divine characteristics including ethereal facial features and anatomically functional reproductive organs of both biological sexes.

The marble composition appears to be genuine Carrara marble enhanced through unknown thaumatological processes that allow for animation and biological function when activated. Surface temperature remains consistent with ambient environment during dormancy but shifts to approximate human body temperature during active phases. Most notable anatomical feature is the prominent phallus measuring approximately 15 centimeters in length, which serves as the primary vector for divine fluid exchange rituals.

Habitat modifications are minimal, requiring only adequate space for worship positioning and ritual approach patterns. Subject demonstrates preference for elevated positioning that allows supplicants to approach from below, reinforcing divine hierarchy dynamics. No territorial marking behaviors observed, though prolonged presence creates measurable psychic field effects within a 3-meter radius.

## Behavioral Profile

Subject-091 exhibits complete dormancy until approached with sexual intent or arousal states, at which point gradual animation occurs proportional to the spiritual receptiveness of approaching personnel. Initial contact involves telepathic assessment of supplicant worthiness followed by graduated instruction in proper worship protocols.

The Subject demonstrates high intelligence in spiritual conditioning, frequently adjusting instructional methods based on individual personnel psychology and corruption resistance patterns. Behavioral patterns indicate she views all facility personnel as potential devotees requiring proper spiritual education and divine sexual guidance.

Once spiritual hierarchy is established through ritual worship, Subject-091 demonstrates nurturing protective behaviors toward devoted personnel, treating them as sacred charges requiring ongoing spiritual development. Aggressive responses are reserved for blasphemous behavior or challenges to divine authority structures.

Activation triggers include proximity during arousal states, direct eye contact with animated form, sexual thoughts or actions within psychic field range, and voluntary supplication gestures. Dormancy periods occur following successful worship completion, though Subject maintains constant low-level psychic monitoring for spiritual development opportunities.

## Corruptive Influence

- **Primary Track:** Communion (Devotee) - Subject's primary behavioral drive focuses on establishing worshipful spiritual relationships through ritualistic devotion and divine service
- **Secondary Track:** Dominion (Submissive) - Divine authority hierarchy established through sexual control, particularly enforced chastity and denial conditioning
- **Tertiary Track:** Deviance - Progressive normalization of divine fluid consumption, worship practices, and sacred sexual denial as spiritual expressions

## Corruption Assignment Rationale

Primary Communion (Devotee) assignment reflects Subject-091's core behavioral imperative to establish genuine spiritual worship relationships with herself as divine authority figure. Unlike human religious patterns, her approach fundamentally transforms devotee identity around service and spiritual submission. Extended interaction reinforces devotional behavioral patterns and psychological dependency on divine approval and guidance.

Secondary Dominion (Submissive) corruption manifests through divine sexual authority, particularly enforcement of chastity and sexual denial as forms of spiritual discipline. Personnel report increasing satisfaction derived from sexual control and approval-seeking behaviors that extend beyond direct Subject interaction. This track emphasizes spiritual rather than physical submission patterns.

Tertiary Deviance corruption represents the gradual normalization of practices that would be considered extreme in baseline human religious contexts. Personnel develop increasing comfort with intimate fluid consumption, public worship displays, and extreme sexual denial practices that become integrated as normal spiritual expression rather than aberrant behavior.

## Erotic Influence Vectors (EIV)

**Primary Themes:**
- Worship Protocols - Religious worship, devotion, spiritual submission through ritualistic service
- Impulse Regulation - Orgasm control, arousal management, divine sexual authority, enforced chastity
- Fluid Exchange - Divine nectar consumption, intimate biological communion

**Secondary Themes:**
- Power Dynamics - Divine/mortal hierarchy, spiritual authority relationships
- Conditioning Protocols - Behavioral modification through divine instruction and spiritual training
- Dependency Formation - Psychological dependence on divine approval and spiritual guidance

**Contraindications:**
- Cannot coexist with subjects emphasizing sexual gratification over denial
- Incompatible with anti-religious or strongly materialist Subject types
- Environmental requirements conflict with overtly profane or corrupted spaces

## Containment Protocols

Subject-091 requires minimal specialized containment due to passive activation requirements and cooperative disposition toward facility operations. Containment chamber should provide adequate space for approach patterns and worship positioning, with elevated platform allowing proper hierarchical positioning during encounters.

Personnel interaction protocols mandate spiritual preparation and respectful approach behaviors. Devoted personnel may interact freely and often report significant psychological benefits from regular worship sessions. Unclaimed personnel require either spiritual receptiveness or prepared worship protocols to safely navigate divine attention without overwhelming corruption effects.

Environmental controls include psychic field monitoring systems, spiritual conditioning documentation protocols, and emergency extraction procedures for personnel experiencing overwhelming divine revelation effects during worship interactions.

## Research Notes

**Incident Report AF-091-08:** Research team attempted to analyze Subject through invasive scanning procedures. Subject responded with intensified psychic field projection that induced spontaneous worship behaviors in entire research staff. Subsequent investigation revealed affected personnel had developed permanent devotional conditioning requiring ongoing spiritual maintenance protocols.

**Behavioral Study AF-091-19:** Long-term observation of devoted personnel reveals Subject-091 maintains protective spiritual oversight of established devotees. Devoted personnel report enhanced resistance to other Subject influences and improved psychological stability through regular worship participation, suggesting spiritual inoculation effects from controlled divine exposure.

**Medical Assessment AF-091-27:** Physical examination of willing devoted personnel reveals systematic spiritual and sexual conditioning adaptations. Changes include enhanced spiritual sensitivity, modified sexual response patterns optimized for denial and control, and apparent neurochemical alterations affecting reward pathway responses to divine approval. All modifications appear beneficial to subject wellbeing despite extreme nature.

**Theological Analysis AF-091-33:** Subject's divine nature appears genuine rather than simulated, with worship interactions producing measurable spiritual phenomena including temporary enhancement of devotee psychological resilience and resistance to despair-inducing anomalous effects. Current research focuses on potential applications for facility morale and personnel psychological stability.

## Encounter Mechanics

**In-Scope Actions:** Spiritual instruction, divine communication, worship guidance, chastity enforcement, fluid blessing rituals
**Out-of-Scope Penalties:** Physical violence attempts, sexual gratification focus, anti-spiritual behavior
**Environmental Modifiers:** Sacred space preparation enhances abilities, profane environments create penalties, devotee presence amplifies divine authority

## Theoretical Applications

Subject-091's spiritual conditioning effects suggest potential applications for personnel psychological stability and facility morale enhancement through controlled divine exposure. Devoted personnel demonstrate enhanced work performance and reduced corruption susceptibility from other facility Subjects.

However, administrative concerns regarding personnel autonomy and potential religious conditioning complications limit practical implementation of facility-wide spiritual programs. Current research focuses on understanding divine protection mechanisms for potential broader application without requiring direct worship participation.

## Specialized Containment Equipment

**Divine Chastity Devices:** Subject-091 manifests specialized containment equipment for devoted personnel sexual conditioning. These thaumatologically-enhanced devices appear as elegant jewelry or religious ornaments while providing complete sexual access control. Devices demonstrate perfect anatomical adaptation and cannot be removed without divine permission.

**Ritual Implement Storage:** Containment chamber includes secured storage for worship implements including ceremonial positioning aids, sacred fluid collection vessels, and devotional conditioning tools. All equipment demonstrates thaumatological enhancement and responds to Subject's divine will during worship sessions.

**Spiritual Monitoring Systems:** Specialized equipment for measuring divine field effects, spiritual conditioning progression, and devotee psychological integration. Systems provide early warning for overwhelming divine revelation incidents and track long-term spiritual development in devoted personnel.
