**Last Updated:** 2025-07-23  
**Purpose:** Unified character mechanics integrating Core Mechanics, Character Creation, Player State, Identity Alignment, and Equipment systems  
**Source Integration:** Character System Documentation, Character Creation Framework, Player State Framework, Identity Alignment Framework, Equipment Framework

---

## 1. Core Character Mechanics

### 1.1 System Overview

The Character System provides the mechanical foundation for representing player characters and companions as they navigate facility corruption. Characters use an RPG-style framework with **Core Meters**, **Attributes**, and **Skillsets** that interact through the Explosive Cascading Roll-and-Keep dice system.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Character development is permanent and cumulative
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear mechanical representation of character capabilities and limitations
- **Cosmic Horror Framework** - Human characters are fundamentally outmatched by supernatural forces, mechanics reflect this reality

#### Core Design Principles Integration

The Character System implements Core Design Principles 2 & 3 from the Game Design Overview, ensuring that player choices create meaningful consequences that persist throughout the facility experience while maintaining clear representation of character capabilities and limitations within the cosmic horror framework.

### 1.2 Character Components

#### Core Meters (Damage/Resilience System)

Core meters represent character resilience pools rather than traditional health. **Zero = incapacitation requiring assistance, not death.**

**Calculation Formula:** Base Meter Value - Total Accumulated Effects = Current Meter Value

#### Unified Meter Effects Integration

Core meters now track multiple influence sources through effects accumulation:

**Vitality Effects Sources:**
```gdscript
vitality_effects: {
    damage: int,              # immediate harm from encounters/hazards
    fatigue: int,             # time without rest, encounter exhaustion
    equipment_strain: int,    # restrictive equipment over time
    corruption_drain: int     # some corruption tracks affect physical state
}
```

**Stability Effects Sources:**
```gdscript
stability_effects: {
    damage: int,              # psychological trauma from encounters
    fatigue: int,             # mental exhaustion from time/encounters
    identity_distress: int,   # dysphoria accumulation from Identity Alignment Framework
    corruption_pressure: int  # certain corruption creating mental strain
}
```

**Inhibition Effects Sources:**
```gdscript
inhibition_effects: {
    damage: int,              # direct inhibition attacks from Subjects
    arousal_pressure: int,    # arousal level 7+ without relief
    denial_amplification: int, # equipment preventing completion
    conditioning_erosion: int  # learned responses weakening resistance
}
```

**Current Meter Calculation:** Base meter value minus total accumulated effects from all sources.

#### Attributes (Dice Pool Determination)

Attributes determine how many dice are rolled for any given action. Range: 2 (Deficient) → 6 (Peak Human), with supernatural corruption enabling progression beyond human limits.

**Attribute Scale:**
- **2 - Deficient:** Below average capability, noticeable limitation
- **3 - Baseline:** Typical human standard, unremarkable
- **4 - Adequate:** Above average, naturally competent
- **5 - Superior:** Exceptional human capability, top percentile
- **6 - Peak Human:** Absolute maximum natural human potential (world-class athletes, geniuses, etc.)

**Four Core Attributes:**

**Physique (PHY)** - *Physical capability, strength, endurance, coordination*
- **Applications:** Combat effectiveness, manual tasks, physical endurance

### 1.3 Dice Resolution System

#### Explosive Cascading Roll-and-Keep Mechanics

**Philosophy:** "Blind luck can win the day" - weak characters can achieve legendary results through favorable dice cascades while maintaining realistic power scaling.

#### Core Resolution Process

1. **Roll Dice Pool:** [Attribute value] dice of [Skillset die size]
2. **Explosive Cascading:** Any maximum result explodes AND steps up one die size (d4→d6→d8→d10→d12→d12)
3. **Keep Results:** Keep [Tier] highest dice for final result
4. **No Cascade Limits:** Rule of Cool - explosions can continue indefinitely

#### Tier System (Keep Values)

- **Tier 1** (Starting Characters): Keep 2 dice (base tier for facility survivors)
- **Tier 2** (Facility Experienced): Keep 3 dice
- **Tier 3** (Deep Facility Veterans): Keep 4 dice
- **Tier 4** (Supernatural Integration): Keep 5+ dice
- **Perk Modifications:** Character perks can modify dice kept (+1 keep common perk reward)

**Advancement:** Tier progression tied to story milestones (approximately every 2 facility floors)

#### Example Resolution

Character: Physique 3, Jock d6, Tier 2

- **Roll:** 3d6
- **Results:** 4, 6, 6
- **Cascading:** 6s become d8s and reroll → 7, 3
- **Final Pool:** 4, 7, 3
- **Keep 2:** 7, 4 = 11 total

#### Modifier Integration

**Positive Modifiers:**
- Equipment bonuses (+1 die, +1 die size, +1 keep)
- Favorable circumstances (environmental advantages)
- Companion assistance (coordinated efforts)
- Beneficial corruption effects (supernatural enhancement)

**Negative Modifiers:**
- Damaged equipment, hostile environment (-1 die, -1 die size)
- Physical/mental damage (meter depletion penalties)
- Time pressure, distraction (-1 keep)
- Detrimental corruption effects (supernatural interference)

**Minimum Resolution:** Always roll at least 1d4, regardless of penalties

#### Universal Application Principle

**Any Attribute can pair with Any Skillset** depending on the specific task:
- Physique + Popular = Physical intimidation through social presence
- Acumen + Jock = Tactical analysis of physical challenges
- Intuition + Nerd = Technical work guided by supernatural sensitivity

#### Difficulty Thresholds

- **Trivial (5):** Basic tasks under normal conditions
- **Easy (10):** Standard professional tasks
- **Moderate (15):** Challenging professional tasks
- **Hard (20):** Expert-level challenges
- **Extreme (25):** Near-impossible tasks requiring exceptional capability

## 3. Player State Integration

### 3.1 System Overview

The Player State Framework provides the unified foundation for all character mechanics, integrating anatomy, arousal, equipment, and agency into one interconnected system. All encounter resolution, corruption effects, narrative generation, and Subject interactions reference this central state to determine available options and content scaling.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **The "Good Porn Games Problem" Solution** - All erotic mechanics serve tactical gameplay through interconnected state management
- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Character state changes create permanent modifications affecting all future interactions
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Equipment and corruption choices create strategic trade-offs with clear mechanical implications across all systems

#### Core Framework Architecture

**Unified Player State Structure:**
```gdscript
PlayerState {
    anatomy_profile: AnatomyProfile,
    arousal_state: ArousalState,
    equipment_state: EquipmentState,
    agency_profile: AgencyProfile,
    status_effects: Array[StatusEffect],
    corruption_modifications: Array[Modification]
}
```

#### Component Integration Principle

**All components affect each other in systematic ways:**
- Equipment compatibility determined by anatomy profile
- Equipment reduces agency levels based on device type and anatomy fit
- Arousal pressure affects decision-making within available agency options
- Agency levels filter available encounter choices and narrative templates
- Status effects modify arousal responses and equipment comfort
- Corruption modifications unlock new anatomy, equipment, and agency interactions

### 3.2 Anatomy Profile Component

#### Comprehensive Anatomy Tracking

```gdscript
AnatomyProfile {
    primary_genitals: {
        type: "penis" | "vagina" | "intersex_variation",
        size_category: "micro" | "small" | "average" | "large" | "enhanced",
        sensitivity: int # 1-5 scale
    },
    secondary_genitals: {
        type: "none" | "penis" | "vagina", # corruption-unlockable
        size_category: String,
        sensitivity: int
    },
    genital_details: {
        testicle_placement: "external" | "internal" | "none",
        anatomical_flags: Array # ["knot", "specialized_features"]
    },
    other_anatomy: {
        chest: {size_category: String, sensitivity: int},
        tongue: {length: int, dexterity: int},
        urethra: {accommodation: int},
        anus: {accommodation: int, sensitivity: int},
        skin: {type: "normal" | "latex" | "enhanced"}
    },
    physical_modifications: Array # corruption additions
}
```

#### Equipment Compatibility Integration

**Anatomy determines equipment fit and effectiveness:**
- Size categories affect chastity device comfort and security
- Testicle placement affects restraint options and compatibility
- Physical modifications may require specialized equipment
- Accommodation levels determine training equipment effectiveness

### 3.3 Arousal State Component

#### Persistent Arousal with Psychological Context

```gdscript
ArousalState {
    current_level: int, # 0-10 scale
    last_source: "clinical" | "emotional" | "coerced" | "equipment",
    conditioned_triggers: Array, # learned arousal responses + targeted attractions
    denial_duration: int, # time since last completion
    completion_history: Array # recent satisfaction events
}
```

#### Inhibition Pressure Mechanics

**Arousal → Inhibition Damage Integration:**
- Arousal level 7+ creates ongoing Inhibition meter damage
- Equipment denial amplifies damage through inability to seek relief
- Zero Inhibition = compulsive sexual seeking, automatic encounter compliance
- Different arousal sources affect resistance effectiveness and choice quality

#### Conditioned Response Framework

**Horror Through Preference Corruption:**
- Encounters add conditioned triggers: `["divine_fluid", "subject_044", "restraint_helplessness"]`
- Later encounters check triggers for automatic arousal responses
- Creates "this better not awaken anything in me" horror moments
- Targeted Subject attractions create tactical vulnerabilities

### 3.4 Equipment State Component

#### Persistent vs Scene Equipment Classification

```gdscript
EquipmentState {
    persistent_devices: Array[PersistentEquipment], # ongoing state modifiers
    scene_items: Array[SceneItem], # temporary encounter enhancers
    key_possession: Dictionary, # who controls access to what
    compatibility_matrix: Dictionary # anatomy-specific restrictions
}

PersistentEquipment {
    device_type: String, # chastity_cage, mitts, gag, restraints, collar
    anatomy_requirements: Array,
    agency_reductions: Dictionary, # what freedoms this removes
    key_holder: String, # companion_id, subject_id, player, lost
    arousal_effects: Dictionary # pressure amplification, stimulation
}

SceneItem {
    item_type: String, # strap_on, vibrator, blindfold, toys
    resource_state: Dictionary, # battery, durability, charges
    compatibility_requirements: Array, # anatomy or equipment prerequisites
    encounter_modifiers: Dictionary # what options this enables/modifies
}
```

#### Equipment Interaction Rules

**Persistent Equipment Effects:**
- Chastity devices prevent arousal relief while amplifying pressure
- Restraints reduce agency categories (mobility, manual control)
- Sensory equipment affects vision and communication agency
- Key possession creates dependency relationships with holders

**Scene Item Integration:**
- Strap-ons enable penetration regardless of anatomy (with chastity compatibility)
- Vibrators provide stimulation options modified by restraint level
- Sensory items (blindfolds, VR) enhance psychological scenarios
- Resource management (batteries, durability) creates strategic planning

### 3.5 Agency Profile Component

#### Freedom Categorization Framework

```gdscript
AgencyProfile {
    mobility: int,      # 0-3: none, limited, moderate, full
    speech: int,        # 0-3: silenced, muffled, limited, free  
    vision: int,        # 0-3: blind, limited, impaired, clear

- **Full Manual:** Normal hand use, object manipulation, equipment operation
- **Restricted Manual:** Hand use limitations from restraints, equipment, or conditions
- **Assisted Manual:** Dependence on equipment or others for hand-dependent tasks
- **Bound:** Complete hand restriction preventing manipulation

#### Agency-Based Content Filtering

**Encounter Choice Availability:**
- Full agency: All encounter options and resistance methods available
- Partial agency: Some choices filtered based on capability restrictions
- Minimal agency: Very limited options, mostly defensive or compliance choices
- Zero agency: Pure narrative experience, no player choices available

**Narrative Template Selection:**
- Agency levels determine available micro-template categories
- "You reach for..." (manual control) vs "You watch helplessly as..."
- Speech agency affects communication and resistance dialogue options
- Vision agency determines surprise elements and positioning awareness

### 3.6 Status Effects Integration

#### Temporary State Modifiers

```gdscript
StatusEffect {
    effect_type: String, # "highly_aroused", "lubricated", "overstimulated", "injured"
    target_component: String, # which framework component this affects
    intensity: int,
    duration: int,
    source: String # what caused this effect
}
```

#### Cross-Component Effect Examples

- **"Naturally Lubricated"** (high arousal affecting anatomy responsiveness)
- **"Equipment Discomfort"** (poor fit affecting arousal and agency)
- **"Overstimulated"** (repeated edging affecting arousal sensitivity)
- **"Injured"** (accommodation damage affecting encounter options)

### 3.7 Cross-System Integration

#### Subject Compatibility Framework

**Subject Requirements Reference Complete Player State:**
```gdscript
# Subject-044 compatibility check
func check_subject_compatibility(player_state, subject_profile):
    var anatomy_match = player_state.anatomy.check_requirements(subject.anatomy_needs)
    var arousal_readiness = player_state.arousal.current_level >= subject.minimum_arousal
    var equipment_compatibility = !player_state.equipment.blocks(subject.preferred_methods)
    var agency_sufficient = player_state.agency.allows(subject.interaction_types)
    
    return CompatibilityResult(anatomy_match, arousal_readiness, equipment_compatibility, agency_sufficient)
```

#### Encounter System Dependencies

**Player State Determines All Encounter Mechanics:**
- Available choice options filtered by agency levels
- Arousal state affects resistance effectiveness and choice quality
- Equipment modifies encounter paths and available resolutions
- Anatomy compatibility determines Subject behavior and satisfaction
- Status effects modify encounter difficulty and content generation

#### Narrative Generation Dependencies

**Dynamic Content Scaling:**
- Anatomy profile drives anatomical description templates
- Arousal source and level determine psychological narrative tone
- Equipment state affects positioning and capability descriptions
- Agency levels filter narrative perspective and choice presentation
- Conditioned triggers modify character response descriptions

#### Corruption System Dependencies

**State Modifications Through Corruption:**
- Metamorphosis corruption unlocks new anatomy options and equipment compatibility
- Corruption encounters apply status effects and modify arousal conditioning
- Threshold rewards provide agency-enhancement perks and equipment access
- Physical modifications change equipment compatibility and Subject attraction

### 3.8 Technical Implementation

#### Godot Integration Architecture

```gdscript
class PlayerStateFramework:
    var anatomy: AnatomyProfile
    var arousal: ArousalState  
    var equipment: EquipmentState
    var agency: AgencyProfile
    var status_effects: Array[StatusEffect]
    
    func update_player_state():
        # Process equipment effects on agency
        agency.calculate_from_equipment(equipment.persistent_devices)
        # Process arousal pressure on inhibition
        arousal.process_inhibition_damage(character.inhibition_meter)
        # Update status effect durations
        status_effects.process_duration_decay()
        # Check for automatic trigger responses
        arousal.check_conditioned_triggers(current_environment)
    
    func get_available_encounter_options(encounter_type):
        return filter_options_by_agency_and_equipment(encounter_type)
    
    func check_equipment_compatibility(new_equipment):
        return anatomy.validates_equipment_fit(new_equipment)
```

#### Save System Requirements

**Complete State Persistence:**
- Anatomy progression and corruption modifications
- Arousal conditioning and trigger development
- Equipment states and key possession tracking
- Agency modification history and current levels
- Status effect persistence and source tracking

## 4. Identity Alignment System

### 4.1 System Overview

The Identity Alignment Framework provides core gender identity mechanics where dysphoria creates genuine tactical pressure and euphoria provides strategic benefits, while equipment control dynamics create relationship dependencies around identity presentation. The system integrates authentic transgender experience with cosmic horror themes through systematic vulnerability targeting and grateful horror mechanics.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **Authentic Experience** - Dysphoria and euphoria as genuine gameplay pressure, not narrative flavor
- **Tactical Integration** - Identity comfort affects decision-making capability and resource management
- **Relationship Architecture** - Equipment control creates power dynamics around identity presentation
- **Grateful Horror** - Forced presentation becoming comfortable creates psychological conditioning horror

#### Authentic Experience Integration

The Identity Alignment Framework integrates authentic transgender experience with cosmic horror themes, respecting real psychological phenomena while serving tactical gameplay and horror mechanics without trivializing or exploiting genuine identity struggles.

#### Tactical Integration Philosophy

Identity comfort functions as a tactical resource requiring active management, with dysphoria creating genuine pressure and euphoria providing strategic advantages, making identity presentation a core element of facility survival rather than cosmetic character customization.

### 4.2 Core Identity State Tracking

#### Primary Identity State Structure

```gdscript
IdentityState {
    gender_identity: String,        # "masculine", "feminine", "nonbinary", "fluid", "questioning"
    current_presentation: String,   # how you're currently presenting to others
    presentation_comfort: int,      # -10 to +10 (severe dysphoria to intense euphoria)
    presentation_source: String,    # "choice", "forced", "equipment", "corruption"
    
    presentation_history: {
        time_in_current: int,       # hours in current presentation
        comfort_trend: Array,       # tracking comfort changes over time
        forced_duration: int        # total time in non-chosen presentations
    }
}
```

#### Presentation Comfort Scale

- **-10 to -6:** Severe dysphoria - major tactical penalties
- **-5 to -1:** Mild dysphoria - minor tactical penalties  
- **0:** Neutral - no bonuses or penalties
- **+1 to +5:** Mild euphoria - minor tactical bonuses
- **+6 to +10:** Intense euphoria - major tactical bonuses

### 4.3 Tactical Effects Integration

#### Unified Meter Effects Implementation

```gdscript
# Identity effects integrated into unified meter system
stability_effects: {
    damage: int,              # psychological trauma
    fatigue: int,             # mental exhaustion 
    identity_distress: int,   # dysphoria accumulation
    corruption_pressure: int  # certain corruption creating mental strain
}

func calculate_identity_distress():
    var distress = 0
    var comfort = identity_state.presentation_comfort
    
    if comfort <= -6:
        distress = 2  # severe dysphoria
    elif comfort <= -1:
        distress = 1  # mild dysphoria
        
    return distress
```

#### Performance Modifiers

```gdscript
func get_identity_modifier() -> Dictionary:
    var modifier = {}
    var comfort = identity_state.presentation_comfort
    
    if comfort <= -6:
        modifier["decision_penalty"] = -2  # dice penalty
        modifier["stress_multiplier"] = 1.5
    elif comfort <= -1:
        modifier["decision_penalty"] = -1
    elif comfort >= 6:
        modifier["confidence_bonus"] = +2  # dice bonus
        modifier["stress_resistance"] = 0.5
        modifier["social_effectiveness"] = +1
    elif comfort >= 1:
        modifier["confidence_bonus"] = +1
        
    return modifier
```

### 4.4 Equipment Integration Layer

#### Presentation Control Mechanics

```gdscript
# Equipment affects identity through presentation forcing
func process_equipment_identity_effects():
    for equipment in persistent_equipment:
        if equipment.has_presentation_override():
            var forced_presentation = equipment.get_presentation_override()
            identity_state.current_presentation = forced_presentation
            identity_state.presentation_source = "equipment"
            
            # Calculate comfort based on identity vs forced presentation
            var comfort = calculate_presentation_comfort(
                identity_state.gender_identity, 
                forced_presentation
            )
            identity_state.presentation_comfort = comfort
```

#### Presentation Arousal Effects (Separate from Identity Comfort)

```gdscript
# Separate from identity comfort - arousal responses to presentation
presentation_arousal_effects: {
    source: String,  # "natural_attraction", "learned_conditioning", "corruption_induced"
    intensity: float, # how much this affects arousal/inhibition
    shame_factor: float # whether this creates internal conflict
}

# Creates inhibition pressure separate from identity comfort
func calculate_presentation_arousal_pressure():
    var arousal_effect = presentation_arousal_effects.intensity
    var shame_multiplier = presentation_arousal_effects.shame_factor
    
    if identity_state.presentation_source == "forced":
        # Arousal from forced presentation creates inhibition damage
        return arousal_effect * shame_multiplier
    
    return arousal_effect
```

### 4.5 Grateful Horror Mechanics

#### Forced Presentation Becoming Comfortable

The core horror emerges when forced presentation gradually becomes preferred through tactical necessity:

**Conditioning Process:**
- Initial forced presentation creates dysphoria (-5 comfort)
- Tactical benefits (arousal management, Subject accommodation) make compliance beneficial
- Repeated exposure gradually shifts comfort from negative to positive
- System triggers horror recognition when forced presentation becomes genuinely preferred

**Psychological Progression:**
- **Phase 1:** Resistance and discomfort with forced presentation
- **Phase 2:** Pragmatic acceptance for tactical benefits
- **Phase 3:** Growing comfort and habituation
- **Phase 4:** Preference development and identity questioning
- **Phase 5:** Horror recognition of autonomous preference shift

#### Conditioning Effects and Recognition

```gdscript
# Time-based conditioning effects
func process_presentation_conditioning(hours_elapsed):
    if identity_state.presentation_source in ["forced", "equipment"]:
        # Gradual comfort increase through exposure
        var conditioning_rate = 0.1 * hours_elapsed
        identity_state.presentation_comfort += conditioning_rate
        conditioning_effects.time_forced += hours_elapsed
        
    elif identity_state.presentation_comfort > 5:
        # Euphoria provides stability resistance
        stability_effects.identity_distress -= hours_elapsed * 0.2
        stability_effects.identity_distress = max(0, stability_effects.identity_distress)
```

### 4.6 Subject Vulnerability Targeting

#### Identity-Based Attack Patterns

**Subjects exploit identity uncertainty for corruption advancement:**

**Presentation Attacks:**
- Subjects removing or modifying identity-supporting equipment
- Public exposure creating presentation dysphoria pressure
- Identity invalidation as psychological warfare technique

**Body Modification Pressure:**
- Subjects offering anatomy modifications addressing dysphoria
- Physical changes providing identity alignment at corruption cost
- Body autonomy removal disguised as identity accommodation

**Social Recognition Manipulation:**
- Subjects providing identity validation in exchange for compliance
- Recognition withdrawal as punishment for resistance
- Identity affirmation as reward for corruption acceptance

#### Corruption Offers Mechanics

```gdscript
# Identity needs create vulnerability to specific corruption tracks
func calculate_corruption_appeal(corruption_type, identity_state):
    var base_appeal = corruption_type.base_appeal
    var identity_modifier = 0
    
    if identity_state.presentation_comfort < -3:
        # Dysphoria makes identity-fixing corruption appealing
        if corruption_type == "Metamorphosis":
            identity_modifier += 3  # physical transformation appeal
        elif corruption_type == "Communion":
            identity_modifier += 2  # acceptance/belonging appeal
    
    return base_appeal + identity_modifier
```

### 4.7 Cross-System Integration Notes

#### Character System Dependencies

- **Unified Meter Effects:** Identity distress integrates with stability_effects tracking
- **Performance Modifiers:** Identity comfort affects dice rolls and decision-making capability
- **Time Integration:** Identity pressure accumulates with other time-based effects (fatigue, arousal)

#### Equipment Framework Dependencies

- **Presentation Control:** Equipment can override clothing choices and lock presentation
- **Removal Control:** Identity presentation depends on who controls clothing/equipment keys
- **Relationship Architecture:** Equipment keyholders control identity presentation autonomy

#### Corruption System Dependencies

- **Grateful Horror:** Identity shifts create Enthrall corruption through conditioning
- **Metamorphosis Integration:** Physical transformation affects identity comfort calculations
- **Threshold Effects:** Identity vulnerability increases with certain corruption levels

#### Subject Classification Dependencies

- **Vulnerability Targeting:** Subjects receive dice bonuses when targeting identity uncertainty
- **Corruption Offers:** Identity discomfort makes transformation offers more appealing
- **Behavioral Modification:** Subject encounter behavior adapts to character identity state

### 4.8 Implementation Testing Framework

#### Identity Pressure Validation Tests

- Character with masculine identity forced into feminine presentation shows negative comfort
- Negative comfort creates ongoing Stability drain requiring tactical management
- Equipment preventing presentation change amplifies pressure over time
- Rest periods do not restore identity distress (only presentation change helps)

#### Grateful Horror Mechanics Tests

- Forced feminine presentation initially causes dysphoria (-5 comfort)
- Tactical necessity (arousal management through "compliance") gradually shifts comfort positive
- System triggers horror recognition when forced presentation becomes preferred
- Conditioning effects persist even when equipment is removed

#### Subject Integration Testing

- Subject-025 gets enhanced dice when targeting dysphoric OR euphoric characters (extreme states)
- Subject-091 offers divine transformation with high appeal to uncomfortable characters
- Identity vulnerability creates Subject behavior modifications and targeting preferences
- Subjects respond appropriately to identity confidence vs uncertainty

#### Equipment Integration Testing

- Clothing changes affect identity comfort appropriately
- Locked clothing creates "equipment" source tracking
- Multiple clothing items stack effects appropriately
- Equipment removal restores "choice" source when possible

## 5. Equipment Framework

### 5.1 System Overview

The Equipment Framework provides unified equipment mechanics through a tri-modal approach (State/Effects/Queries) serving three equipment categories (Persistent/Scene/Utility). The system creates relationship architecture through removal control dynamics while supporting identity presentation, arousal management, agency modification, and power exchange themes.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **Relationship Architecture** - Equipment control creates power dynamics and dependency relationships
- **Tri-Modal Integration** - Equipment modifies state, applies effects, and answers capability queries
- **Equipment Evolution** - Items progress from inventory through persistent equipment to biological integration
- **Power Exchange Mechanics** - Removal control becomes the foundation for BDSM dynamics and cosmic horror agency elimination

#### Relationship Architecture Philosophy

Equipment control becomes the foundation for complex relationship dynamics through removal dependencies, key possession, and negotiated access, creating authentic power exchange mechanics that serve both erotic themes and tactical gameplay.

#### Tri-Modal Integration Approach

Every piece of equipment serves three distinct mechanical functions simultaneously - modifying character state, applying ongoing effects, and answering capability queries - ensuring equipment integration across all game systems without redundant mechanics.

### 5.2 Core Equipment Architecture

#### Tri-Modal Equipment Function

**Equipment serves three distinct mechanical functions:**

```gdscript
Equipment {
    // STATE-BASED: What it does to your baseline
    state_modifications: {
        anatomy_accessibility: Dictionary,  # what's blocked/available
        presentation_override: String,      # forced appearance
        agency_reductions: Dictionary       # mobility, speech, etc.
    },
    
    // EFFECT-BASED: Ongoing processes it creates
    active_effects: {
        arousal_pressure: float,           # amplification/reduction
        comfort_modification: int,         # identity impact
        meter_drain_rates: Dictionary      # ongoing damage/healing
    },
    
    // QUERY-BASED: Capability questions it can answer
    func can_access_anatomy(type: String) -> bool
    func allows_presentation_change() -> bool  
    func enables_subject_interaction(subject_type: String) -> bool
}
```

#### Equipment Category Taxonomy

**Three Equipment Categories with Distinct Mechanical Roles:**

```gdscript
enum EquipmentCategory {
    PERSISTENT,    # Ongoing state modifiers, relationship dependencies
    SCENE,         # Temporary encounter enhancers, resource management
    UTILITY        # Facility navigation, environmental protection
}
```

### 5.3 Persistent Equipment System

#### Relationship Control Architecture

**Persistent Equipment creates dependency relationships through removal control:**

```gdscript
PersistentEquipment {
    removal_requirements: {
        method: "key" | "dice_roll" | "story_event" | "impossible",
        controller: "player" | "companion_id" | "subject_id" | "lost",
        difficulty: int,  # if dice roll required
        failure_consequences: Array  # what happens if removal fails
    },
    
    dependency_effects: {
        psychological_attachment: float,  # withdrawal effects when removed
        relationship_binding: String,     # who controls your state
        removal_anxiety: int             # stress from inability to remove
    },
    
    state_modifications: {
        identity_presentation: String,    # forced appearance changes
        anatomy_access: Dictionary,       # what's blocked or available
        agency_restrictions: Dictionary   # capability limitations
    }
}
```

#### Persistent Equipment Examples

**Chastity Devices:**
```gdscript
chastity_cage: {
    removal_requirements: {
        method: "key",
        controller: "scholar_companion",  # relationship dependency
        failure_consequences: ["arousal_spike", "frustration_damage"]
    },
    state_modifications: {
        anatomy_access: {"genital_stimulation": false, "penetration_giving": false},
        arousal_prevention: true
    },
    active_effects: {
        arousal_pressure: 2.0,  # amplifies arousal accumulation
        denial_amplification: 1.5  # increases inhibition pressure
    }
}
```

**Restraints:**
```gdscript
mitts: {
    removal_requirements: {
        method: "key",
        controller: "protector_companion",
        difficulty: 15  # if attempting self-removal
    },
    state_modifications: {
        agency_restrictions: {"manual_control": 0},  # complete hand restriction
        dependency_creation: ["feeding", "equipment_operation", "personal_care"]
    },
    dependency_effects: {
        psychological_attachment: 0.3,  # gradual comfort with helplessness
        relationship_binding: "protector_companion"
    }
}
```

### 5.4 Scene Equipment System

#### Resource Management Framework

**Scene Equipment provides temporary tactical advantages with resource costs:**

```gdscript
SceneEquipment {
    resource_state: {
        battery_level: int,               # 0-100 for powered equipment
        durability: int,                  # wear from use
        charges_remaining: int,           # limited-use items
        maintenance_required: bool        # needs repair/cleaning
    },
    
    encounter_modifiers: {
        available_actions: Array,         # what new options this enables
        effectiveness_bonuses: Dictionary, # enhanced success rates
        compatibility_requirements: Array # anatomy/equipment prerequisites
    }
}
```

#### Encounter Enhancement Mechanics

**Scene Equipment Example - Vibrators:**
```gdscript
vibrator: {
    resource_state: {
        battery_level: 85,
        durability: 92,
        maintenance_required: false
    },
    encounter_modifiers: {
        available_actions: ["provide_stimulation", "arousal_management", "inhibition_relief"],
        effectiveness_bonuses: {"arousal_control": +3, "subject_satisfaction": +2},
        compatibility_requirements: ["accessible_anatomy", "manual_agency > 1"]
    },
    active_effects: {
        arousal_pressure: -0.5  # provides relief when used
    }
}
```

**Resource Degradation:**
```gdscript
# Equipment degrades through use
func process_scene_equipment_degradation():
    for equipment in scene_equipment:
        # Battery drain from use
        if equipment.battery_powered and equipment.active:
            equipment.battery_level -= usage_drain_rate
            if equipment.battery_level <= 0:
                disable_equipment_functions(equipment)
                
        # Durability from encounters
        if equipment.used_in_encounter():
            equipment.durability -= encounter_wear
            if equipment.durability <= 20:
                equipment.maintenance_required = true
                
        # Charges for limited-use items
        if equipment.charge_based and equipment.used:
            equipment.charges_remaining -= 1
            if equipment.charges_remaining <= 0:
                remove_from_inventory(equipment)
```

### 5.5 Utility Equipment System

#### Facility Navigation Support

**Utility Equipment enables facility interaction without erotic implications:**

```gdscript
UtilityEquipment {
    facility_functions: {
        access_permissions: Array,        # doors, systems you can open
        environmental_protection: Dictionary, # hazard resistance
        tool_capabilities: Array,         # what tasks this enables
        information_access: Dictionary    # data you can retrieve
    },
    
    mechanical_benefits: {
        skill_bonuses: Dictionary,        # enhanced capabilities
        facility_integration: Array,     # systems you can interface with
        safety_margins: Dictionary       # reduced risk from facility dangers
    }
}
```

#### Environmental Protection Mechanics

**Utility Equipment Examples:**

**Access Cards:**
```gdscript
researcher_keycard: {
    facility_functions: {
        access_permissions: ["research_labs", "medical_bay", "data_terminals"],
        information_access: {"subject_files": "basic", "facility_logs": "researcher_level"}
    }
}
```

**Protective Equipment:**
```gdscript
hazmat_suit: {
    facility_functions: {
        environmental_protection: {"chemical_exposure": 0.8, "biological_hazards": 0.9}
    },
    mechanical_benefits: {
        safety_margins: {"contamination_zones": +5, "subject_territories": +2}
    }
}
```

### 5.6 Equipment Evolution Pipeline

#### Equipment Lifecycle Progression

**Equipment can evolve through systematic progression:**

```gdscript
enum EquipmentEvolutionStage {
    INVENTORY_ITEM,        # Owned, optional use
    SCENE_EQUIPMENT,       # Active use in encounters
    PERSISTENT_EQUIPMENT,  # Locked on, ongoing effects
    CORRUPTION_INTEGRATION, # Bonds with character biology
    PERMANENT_TRANSFORMATION # Becomes anatomy through Metamorphosis
}
```

#### Corruption-Driven Equipment Transformation

**Evolution Trigger Framework:**
- **Usage Familiarity:** Extended equipment use creates attachment and comfort
- **Corruption Thresholds:** Specific corruption levels unlock evolution options
- **Story Integration:** Narrative events provide evolution opportunities
- **Character Choice:** Player accepts transformation for benefits

**Evolution Examples:**
```gdscript
# Chastity device evolution
chastity_evolution: {
    stage_1: "voluntary_wearing",        # player choice for tactical benefits
    stage_2: "keyholder_dependency",     # relationship control establishment
    stage_3: "psychological_attachment", # comfort with restriction
    stage_4: "biological_integration",  # metamorphosis corruption threshold
    stage_5: "permanent_anatomy"        # irreversible transformation
}
```

### 5.7 Relationship Architecture Implementation

#### Keyholder Dependency Dynamics

**Equipment Control Creates Power Relationships:**

```gdscript
func process_keyholder_relationships():
    for equipment in persistent_equipment:
        var controller = equipment.removal_requirements.controller
        
        if controller != "player":
            # Create dependency relationship
            var relationship = get_relationship(controller)
            relationship.power_over_player += equipment.dependency_strength
            
            # Enable equipment-based interactions
            enable_relationship_events([
                "equipment_negotiation",

            ])
            
            # If controller is corrupted, affects equipment access
            if relationship.corruption_level > 5:
                equipment.corruption_influence += 0.1
                enable_equipment_corruption_scenarios(equipment, controller)
```

#### Equipment Negotiation Framework

**Removal Control Creates Tactical Relationships:**

```gdscript
func generate_equipment_negotiation_options(equipment, keyholder):
    var options = []
    var relationship = get_relationship(keyholder)
    
    # Standard negotiation options
    options.append("request_temporary_removal")
    options.append("propose_alternative_restraint")
    options.append("offer_service_exchange")
    
    # Relationship-specific options
    if relationship.trust_level > 3:
        options.append("appeal_to_care")
        options.append("request_equipment_upgrade")
    
    if relationship.corruption_level > 5:
        options.append("accept_additional_control")  # corrupted keyholder demands more
        options.append("submit_to_extended_bondage")
    
    # Equipment-specific options
    if equipment.type == "chastity_device":
        options.append("request_supervised_relief")
        options.append("propose_release_schedule")
    
    return options
```

### 5.8 Cross-System Integration

#### Identity Framework Dependencies

- **Presentation Control:** Equipment can override clothing choices and lock presentation
- **Identity Comfort Integration:** Equipment appearance affects identity alignment comfort/dysphoria
- **Forced Presentation Mechanics:** Equipment creating presentation conflicts for grateful horror

#### Arousal State Integration

- **Arousal Pressure Modification:** Equipment amplifies or reduces arousal accumulation
- **Denial/Relief Mechanisms:** Equipment controls access to arousal resolution
- **Conditioning Integration:** Equipment creating arousal triggers and learned responses

#### Agency Modification Mechanics

- **Systematic Agency Reduction:** Equipment reduces mobility, speech, vision, manual control
- **Capability Filtering:** Equipment determines available encounter options and narrative choices
- **Dependency Creation:** Equipment limitations requiring companion assistance
