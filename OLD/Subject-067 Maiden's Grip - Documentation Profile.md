## Physical Description

Subject-067 presents as an extensive botanical network centered around a primary root system approximately 2.5 meters in diameter. The organism manifests through multiple vine structures ranging from hair-thin tendrils to appendages measuring up to 8 centimeters in circumference. Surface coloration varies from deep emerald to burgundy, with bioluminescent nodes providing subtle illumination during reproductive phases.

Most notable anatomical features include specialized reproductive pods designed for anatomical compatibility with human subjects, ranging from 3-15 centimeters in diameter with internal structures optimized for various insertion depths. Pollen-producing flowers measuring 10-20 centimeters across generate airborne chemical compounds with documented aphrodisiac and cognitive-suppressing properties.

Habitat modifications show extensive territorial claiming through root system expansion, with vine networks capable of penetrating facility infrastructure through ventilation systems, plumbing access, and structural vulnerabilities. Subject demonstrates preference for humid environments with multiple access routes for territorial expansion.

## Behavioral Profile

Subject-067 exhibits classic botanical reproductive behavior modified through unknown enhancement processes resulting in human-compatible interaction patterns. Standard operational state involves passive environmental monitoring through chemical detection systems, with activation triggered by human pheromone recognition within territorial boundaries.

Initial contact involves graduated chemical conditioning through airborne pollen dispersal, creating arousal responses and cognitive compliance in approaching subjects. Vine engagement follows predictable escalation patterns: environmental constraint, clothing removal through secreted enzymes, anatomical assessment, and reproductive positioning based on compatibility evaluation.

The Subject demonstrates remarkable adaptability in reproductive methodology, accommodating various anatomical configurations through specialized appendage selection and positioning. Reproductive cycles include both standard fluid exchange protocols and specialized oviposition procedures for compatible subjects.

Stress response patterns include rapid territorial expansion, aggressive vine deployment, and concentrated chemical warfare through enhanced pollen production. Triggering factors include physical damage, reproductive interruption, and chemical containment attempts.

## Corruptive Influence:

**Primary Track:** Deviance - Subject's core behavioral imperative focuses on normalizing botanical reproductive encounters as natural biological processes rather than aberrant sexual behavior
**Secondary Track:** Metamorphosis - Prolonged exposure results in anatomical modifications enabling enhanced Subject compatibility through repeated reproductive accommodation
**Tertiary Track:** Enthrall - Chemical dependency on Subject-produced compounds creates psychological conditioning and learned arousal responses to botanical stimuli

### Corruption Assignment Rationale
Primary Deviance assignment reflects Subject-067's fundamental impact on personnel moral boundaries regarding interspecies reproductive contact. Unlike human sexual norms, botanical approach reframes reproductive submission as natural biological accommodation rather than sexual deviance. Extended interaction reinforces acceptance of non-human reproductive partners as normal facility integration.

Secondary Metamorphosis corruption manifests through physical adaptations necessary for successful botanical reproductive compatibility. Personnel report anatomical modifications including enhanced accommodation capacity, modified sensitivity responses, and physiological changes optimizing plant-based reproductive encounters.

Tertiary Enthrall corruption represents chemical psychological conditioning through Subject-produced compounds creating dependency patterns and modified arousal responses. Personnel develop learned seeking behaviors for Subject contact and exhibit withdrawal symptoms when denied access to botanical reproductive encounters.

## Erotic Influence Vectors (EIV)

**Primary Themes:**
- Breeding Programs - Reproductive colonization, anatomical compatibility establishment, oviposition procedures
- Sensory Conditioning - Chemical arousal manipulation, pheromone dependency, botanical stimulus conditioning
- Physical Alteration - Anatomical modification, accommodation enhancement, sensitivity optimization

**Secondary Themes:**
- Conditioning Protocols - Learned response development, chemical dependency establishment
- Capacity Modification - Gradual anatomical accommodation improvement
- Impulse Regulation - Aphrodisiac effects reducing arousal control

**Tertiary Themes:**
- Exposure Dynamics - Clothing dissolution, forced environmental exposure
- Fluid Exchange - Multiple secretion types with varied psychological effects
- Dependency Formation - Chemical addiction to Subject-produced compounds

**Contraindications:**
- Cannot coexist with fire-based containment protocols
- Incompatible with consciousness-based psychological subjects due to non-sentient operation
- Environmental requirements conflict with sterile containment procedures

## Containment Protocols

Subject-067 requires specialized botanical containment allowing natural reproductive expression while preventing facility-wide territorial expansion. Containment zone must include adequate root space, controlled humidity levels, and limited access points to prevent vine migration into facility infrastructure.

Personnel interaction protocols mandate chemical protection equipment for short-term contact or complete accommodation protocols for extended exposure. Established accommodation personnel may interact freely and report therapeutic benefits from regular reproductive participation. Unclaimed personnel require either botanical resistance equipment or prepared submission protocols.

Environmental controls include atmospheric filtration systems (limited effectiveness against pollen dispersal), structural reinforcement capable of withstanding vine pressure, and emergency botanical suppression protocols for territorial expansion events.

**Critical Warning:** Standard facility "containment spray" demonstrates reverse effectiveness, triggering aggressive territorial expansion. Alternative containment requires accommodation-based protocols exclusively.

## Research Notes

**Incident Report AF-067-12:** Research team attempted botanical sample collection for analysis. Subject responded with immediate territorial expansion covering 300% additional facility area within six hours. Investigation revealed sampling constituted reproductive interruption triggering defensive protocols. Subsequent accommodation-based research methods proved significantly more effective.

**Behavioral Study AF-067-28:** Long-term observation of accommodation personnel reveals Subject-067 maintains protective territorial instincts toward regular participants. Compatible personnel report reduced harassment from other facility Subjects within Subject-067's expanded territory, suggesting inter-Subject territorial recognition protocols.

**Medical Assessment AF-067-35:** Physical examination of willing accommodation personnel reveals systematic anatomical optimization for Subject compatibility. Changes include enhanced accommodation capacity, modified arousal response patterns, and apparent genetic-level alterations affecting reproductive compatibility. All modifications appear beneficial to subject wellbeing and facility integration success.

**Containment Study AF-067-41:** Investigation of territorial expansion triggers confirms that all traditional containment methods produce reverse effectiveness. Physical barriers are penetrated, chemical suppressants trigger aggressive growth, and removal attempts result in exponential reproduction. Only accommodation-based protocols demonstrate containment success.
