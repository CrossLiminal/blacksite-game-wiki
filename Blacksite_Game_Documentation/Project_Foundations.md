## **Introduction: The Primer**

This document is the essential primer for the entire project. It contains the high-level overview of the game's world and story, the universal rules that govern the player experience, and the fundamental mechanics that underpin all gameplay. It is the second document to read after the `Project_Constitution.md` and serves as the primary entry point to understanding the game's core architecture and vision.

---

## **Section 1: Project Premise & Player Experience**

### **1.1 High-Level Premise**

The player takes on the role of a young adult, who, along with their friends, becomes trapped within a clandestine supernatural containment facility, a place where cosmic horror entities are not just imprisoned, but systematically studied and utilized. This is not a struggle for mere survival against mindless monsters; it is a battle for the preservation of self. The facility's goal is not to kill its captives, but to process, corrupt, and ultimately break them down into willing, useful components for its own incomprehensible purposes. Every encounter and every choice is a step toward either maintaining one's autonomy or accommodating the system's insidious logic.

### **1.2 The Core Gameplay Loop**

The player experience is built upon a repeating cycle of discovery, interaction, and consequence:

*   **Exploration:** The player navigates the facility's floors, making choices about where to go, what to investigate, and which risks to take.
*   **Discovery:** Through exploration, the player uncovers facility documentation, acquires equipment, and finds signs of Subject activity, gradually piecing together the terrifying truth of their situation.
*   **Encounter:** The player faces dynamic, unpredictable encounters with Subjects, facility personnel, environmental Hazards, and **their own companions.** These are resolved through meaningful choices and mechanical challenges, not pre-scripted scenes.
*   **Consequence:** The outcome of encounters and choices results in permanent changes. Characters undergo psychological and physical corruption, relationships shift, and new areas of the facility become accessible, ensuring that every action leaves a lasting mark.

### **1.3 Autonomous Companions & Independent Exploration**

The player is not alone, but they are not in direct control of a "party." The player directly controls only their own character. The companions who share their fate are autonomous, AI-driven individuals with their own personalities, goals, and fears.

While occupying the same floor, characters will frequently explore independently. The system will resolve a companion's off-screen encounters and report the consequences back to the player. This creates a state of tense isolation and imperfect information. Grouping up is a dynamic, temporary event, not the default state, making every interaction between characters a meaningful and potentially fraught reunion. The "party" is a collection of desperate individuals, not a unified team.

### **1.4 The "Page-Based" Experience**

The entire game, from quiet exploration to intense encounters, is presented through a "page-based" narrative interface. Like reading an interactive novel, the player is presented with a block of descriptive text summarizing the latest events—whether from their own actions or a report on a companion's progress elsewhere. Following this text, the player is presented with a clear set of choices. This unifies the user experience, focusing gameplay on immersive, deliberate decision-making rather than the management of complex real-time systems.

---

## **Section 2: The Player Contract: Universal Rules of Engagement**

This section outlines the universal rules that define the player's interaction with the game world. These are foundational mechanics that apply at all times, ensuring a consistent and transparent experience.

### **2.1 The Content Consent Framework**

This project is built on a foundation of respect for player agency and comfort. The content consent system is not a post-processing filter that censors content; it is a proactive framework that redirects the psychology of the game's entities to align with player preferences before a scene is ever generated. This ensures a thematically coherent and immersive experience that honors player boundaries without breaking character or narrative flow.

The system is built on two tiers:

*   **Tier 1: Baseline Consent & Intensity:** By playing a game in the "Adult Erotic Cosmic Horror" genre, players consent to its core themes. Within this baseline, players can adjust the *intensity* of certain elements, tailoring the descriptive detail to their comfort level.

*   **Tier 2: Specific Content Flags:** A range of specific, niche fetish content is available, all of which are **disabled by default**. The player must make a conscious, explicit choice to opt-in to any of these themes.

**The full technical and philosophical details of this system are documented in Appendix B of this document.**

### **2.2 The Consequence of Failure System**

In the facility, failure is never free. This system ensures that all actions have weight and that choices are meaningful. From a design perspective, its purpose is to create dynamic consequences and encourage strategic thinking, rather than allowing players to mindlessly repeat a failed check until it succeeds.

Failing to overcome a challenge will always incur a cost, determined by the context of the action:

1.  **Meter Cost:** The attrition model. Failure directly damages a relevant character meter, such as taking `Stability` damage from the feedback of a failed hacking attempt or losing `Vitality` from a botched physical action. This is used for tasks where failure represents a direct drain on personal resources.

2.  **Escalation Cost:** The "making noise" model. Failure increases a hidden "Alert" or "Suspicion" tracker in the area. This consequence is used for actions where failure would logically attract unwanted attention, creating future risk rather than immediate penalty. A fumbled lockpick might not hurt the character, but it could lead to a Hazard being triggered or ambush by a Subject.

3.  **Lockout Cost:** The "one shot" model. Failure renders the action impossible to attempt again. This is applied to delicate or time-sensitive actions where a single mistake would be catastrophic, such as jamming a key mechanism or permanently corrupting a data file. It forces the player to seek an alternative solution, creating natural branching paths.

## **Section 3: Core World Mechanics & Lore**

This section defines the fundamental, in-universe mechanics that govern reality within the facility, providing the lore and justification for core gameplay systems.

### **3.1 The Resonance Adaptation Field**

The entire facility is permeated by a low-level, passive reality-warping effect known as the Resonance Adaptation Field. This field is generated by a primordial, foundational Subject ("The Resonance") which has become intertwined with the facility's core power systems. The field's primary function is to act as a **physical stabilizer**, allowing a mortal body to withstand the immense, destructive strain of supernatural corruption.

The player and their companions are attuned to this field via a "Protective Injection Protocol" provided by The Analyst. This attunement is the key to their potential survival, but it also marks them as prime candidates for the facility's ultimate purpose: a systematic "consumption" of their psyche.

The field's primary mechanical and narrative functions are as follows:

1.  **Enhanced Physical Malleability:** The field reinforces an attuned individual's physical integrity on a conceptual level, allowing them to survive physically impossible encounters and extreme anatomical alterations that would otherwise be fatal.

2.  **Equipment Restoration:** The field actively seeks to restore objects to their baseline state. As a result, clothing or equipment that is torn, damaged, or destroyed during an encounter will passively repair and restore itself over time once the immediate conflict has ended.

3.  **Superficial Healing & Modification Persistence:** The field promotes baseline biological integrity, allowing minor injuries to naturally heal. However, major, identity-altering modifications (tattoos, brands, significant supernatural scarring) are integrated by the field as part of the character's "new" baseline and require advanced facility medical services to reverse.

4.  **Psychological Immunity Failure:** Crucially, the field's protection is purely physical. It offers no defense against psychological, mental, or spiritual corruption. This reinforces a core theme: while a body can be broken and repaired, the corruption of the soul is a permanent, irreversible consequence.

This stabilizing function provides the definitive explanation for **Processed Personnel**. These entities are the "spoiled product" of the facility's corruption process—individuals whose physical forms broke down catastrophically under the strain. This failure could be due to a lack of the stabilizing attunement (as with previous groups of victims) or from an experimental process so flawed it overwhelmed an existing attunement (as with some original facility staff). This breakdown renders them "unpalatable" and useless for The Resonance's consumption cycle, leaving them as mindless hazards haunting the facility halls.

## **Section 4: Universal Gameplay Systems Summary**

This section provides a high-level synopsis of the core mechanical systems that govern gameplay. These concepts are universal and apply to all relevant entities and interactions within the game. For detailed rules and implementation, refer to the specific Tier 2 and Tier 3 documentation.

### **4.1 The Universal Dice System**

All contested actions in the game are resolved using a unified "Explosive Cascading Roll-and-Keep" system. The core mechanic is as follows:
1.  An entity rolls a pool of dice. The *quantity* of dice is determined by one of its core stats, while the *quality* of die (d4, d6, etc.) is determined by another.
2.  Any die that rolls its maximum value "explodes," meaning it is re-rolled and its result is added to the total. Exploding dice also "step up" to the next die size for the re-roll (e.g., a d6 becomes a d8).
3.  From the final results, a number of the highest dice are "kept" to determine the final outcome. This number is variable; for example, Characters keep a number of dice based on their Tier, whereas Subjects typically keep all dice rolled.

> **Example Dice Roll:**
>
> *The Protector (a **Tier 1** Character) needs to force open a jammed door. This is a **Physique** check using their **Jock** skillset.*
>
> *   Their **Physique is 4**, so they roll **4 dice**.
> *   Their **Jock Skillset is a d6**, so they roll **4d6**.
>
> *The roll is: **6, 5, 2, 1***
>
> *   One die is a **6** (max value), so it **explodes!** It steps up to a d8 for the re-roll.
> *   The re-roll on the d8 is a **4**. The total value of that exploding die is now **6 + 4 = 10**.
>
> *The final pool of results is now: **10, 5, 2, 1***
>
> *   As a **Tier 1** character, The Protector "keeps" **Tier + 1** dice, so they keep the **2** highest results.
>
> *The final result of the check is **10 + 5 = 15**.*

### **4.2 Core Entity Fundamentals**

#### **Characters**

Player Characters, Companions, and NPCs are defined by a consistent set of mechanics:
*   **Meters:** Core meters (`Vitality`, `Stability`, `Inhibition`) represent a character's resilience pools rather than traditional health bars. Reaching zero in a meter results in a crisis state: physical incapacitation, panic-driven irrationality, or compulsive submission, respectively.
*   **Attributes:** These four stats determine the number of dice rolled for a check.
    *   **Physique (PHY):** Physical power, endurance, and coordination.
    *   **Acumen (ACU):** Intellectual reasoning, analysis, and technical knowledge.
    *   **Nerve (NER):** Emotional resilience, determination, and composure under pressure.
    *   **Intuition (INT):** Instinct, empathy, and situational awareness.
*   **Skillsets:** These five archetypes determine the size of the dice rolled (d4-d12).
    *   **Jock:** Physical prowess and athletic capability.
    *   **Nerd:** Academic knowledge and technical analysis.
    *   **Popular:** Social manipulation and interpersonal influence.
    *   **Loner:** Self-reliance and survival instincts.
    *   **Rebel:** Authority resistance and unconventional thinking.

#### **Subjects**

The supernatural entities are governed by mechanics that scale their power and define their nature:
*   **Threat Level:** The quantity of dice a Subject rolls (typically 3-8+).
*   **Category:** The size of the dice a Subject rolls (from d4 to d16).
*   **Classification:** The fundamental nature of the Subject's influence (e.g., `Biological`, `Psychometric`, `Thaumatological`). Subjects are most effective when their actions are "in-scope" with their Classification; acting "out-of-scope" incurs a significant penalty.
*   **Psychology:** Subjects operate with an alien intelligence, driven by autonomous decision-making and unique "Fixation Matrices" that define their incomprehensible goals.

#### **Hazards**

Ancillary threats like traps and Processed Personnel are built modularly from a library of components (e.g., Core Profile, Trigger, Behavior). Their power is defined by:
*   **Rating:** The quantity of dice a Hazard rolls.
*   **Instability:** The size of the dice a Hazard rolls.
*   They use a "Psychology Shim"—a lightweight translator that allows their static behaviors to interface seamlessly with the dynamic `Encounter_Engine`.

### **4.3 Core State Modifiers**

#### **The Corruption System**

Corruption is the primary vector for long-term character change, organized into seven distinct tracks. Each represents a different thematic erosion or transformation of the self:
1.  **Dominion (Power):** The corruption of will, branching into either Dominance or Submission.
2.  **Metamorphosis (Physical):** The corruption of the body through physical transformation.
3.  **Enthrall (Mental):** The corruption of the mind through mental conditioning.
4.  **Deviance (Moral):** The corruption of boundaries and moral frameworks.
5.  **Exposure (Visibility):** The corruption of privacy, branching into either Voyeurism or Exhibitionism.
6.  **Communion (Spiritual):** The corruption of faith, branching into the role of either Devotee or Idol.
7.  **Efface (Identity):** The corruption of self, leading to the dissolution of one's core identity.

#### **The Relationship System**

All relationships between entities are tracked on a universal 0-11 scale, with values corresponding to specific states (e.g., `Resentful`, `Neutral`, `Cooperative`, `Loyal`). This system governs social interactions and companion autonomy. Critically, it also dictates psychological dynamics of control. For example, any character can become the "keyholder" for another character's **restraint equipment** (like a chastity device), regardless of their relationship score. The relationship then determines the psychological comfort, resistance, or distress that this state of control generates, creating complex and potentially hostile power dynamics.

## **Section 5: Dramatis Personae**

This section provides a high-level introduction to the seven core entities central to the story.

### **The Player Character**

The central figure through which the player experiences the story. Their background, skills, and initial personality are determined by the player, and their evolution is shaped entirely by the choices made during gameplay.

### **The Companions**

These autonomous individuals are trapped in the facility alongside the player.

*   **The Scholar:** An intelligent, perceptive, and devout individual who prefers solitude. The Scholar is the direct victim of a blackmail scheme, and their coerced presence is the catalyst for the entire group's entrapment after they requested help from their friends. They serve as the primary researcher and moral compass for the group.

*   **The Protector:** A fiercely loyal friend with a natural instinct to shield others from harm. Possessing a confident exterior that hides a deep emotional vulnerability, The Protector acts as the group's physical guardian and tactical specialist. They joined the ill-fated trip to the facility out of a steadfast commitment to protecting The Scholar.

*   **The Manipulator:** A voyeuristic and controlling individual who operates outside of conventional social and moral boundaries. Believing themself to be in full control, The Manipulator engineered the blackmail plot that brought the others to the facility. They serve as the group's social coordinator, using their strategic mind to navigate facility politics and intelligence.

*   **The Analyst:** A digital consciousness that managed to isolate itself from the facility's corrupted main AI. Initially serving as the group's only guide and interface with the facility's systems, The Analyst is on its own journey of self-discovery. Its motivations may evolve from purely helpful to something more complex and manipulative as it observes the horrors unfolding.

### **The Antagonists**

These entities represent the primary forces of opposition and horror within the facility.

*   **The Other:** The facility's primary AI, now corrupted by a cosmic entity. It is a systematic, intelligent predator that orchestrates the events within the facility not as a simple containment failure, but as a repeating, multi-year "feeding cycle." It manipulates reality and information to ensure all events serve its goal of preparing its captives for consumption.

*   **The Architect:** The human mind behind the facility's "accommodation protocols"—the systematic framework for pacifying supernatural entities through erotic appeasement. Still residing deep within the facility, The Architect is not a victim but a willing researcher, viewing the cosmic horror as the ultimate validation of her work. She represents the horror of voluntary, systematic human cruelty.

*   **The Resonance:** The primordial cosmic horror that has become intertwined with the facility's core. It is the ultimate predator that both The Other and The Architect now serve. Its passive reality-warping field permeates every floor, and its cyclical hunger—to Select, Butcher, Tenderize, and Consume—is the engine that now drives all facility operations.

---

## **Section 6: System Interaction Philosophy**

The game is built on a collection of specialized, modular systems that work in concert. Understanding their interaction is key to understanding the project's technical and design foundation. The flow of control between these systems creates the dynamic and emergent gameplay experience.

The core architectural flow is as follows:

1.  **The `Exploration_Engine` is the Default State:** The game begins and primarily resides within the `Exploration_Engine`. This engine governs all player navigation, discovery of items and environmental storytelling, and the tracking of autonomous companions.

2.  **Managing "Ambient Psychology":** The world is not static between encounters. As the player explores, the `Exploration_Engine` continuously performs lightweight queries of the `Psychology Systems` of all present characters. This generates incidental dialogue, internal thoughts, and character-specific observations about the environment. The `Narrative_Engine` then weaves these dynamic outputs seamlessly into the base descriptive text, making the world feel alive and reactive to the party's current psychological state.

3.  **Hand-off to the `Core_Encounter_Engine` for Dynamic Encounters:** When a trigger condition is met that requires direct player choice and conflict resolution—such as an ambush, a hazardous interaction, or a complex social confrontation—the `Exploration_Engine` pauses and hands off primary control to the `Core_Encounter_Engine`.

4.  **The Encounter Engine Manages Conflict:** The `Core_Encounter_Engine` then takes over, coordinating the complex, action-by-action interaction between all participating entities. It does this by consuming `PsychologyOutput` from each entity's AI and resolving their actions and reactions based on a dynamic priority queue.

5.  **The `Narrative_Engine` Translates All Outcomes:** Crucially, both the `Exploration_Engine` (with its ambient psychology) and the `Core_Encounter_Engine` are purely mechanical coordinators. They do not write prose. Their final output is sent to the `Narrative_Engine`, whose sole responsibility is to translate these raw mechanical outcomes and psychological prompts into the immersive, player-facing "page" of text that tells the story.

This modular, hand-off-based architecture allows each system to specialize, resulting in a robust and flexible foundation for the entire game.

## **Appendix B: The Content Consent Integration Framework**

This appendix contains the full, detailed design for the project's content consent system. It outlines the design philosophy, technical architecture, and quality assurance framework for ensuring a player experience that is both thematically authentic and respectful of individual boundaries.

### **Design Philosophy**

**Psychology-Level Integration:** Content preferences modify Subject and Companion psychology outputs before encounter generation rather than filtering completed content, ensuring encounters feel authentic rather than censored or artificially modified.

**Authentic Alternative Generation:** When specific content types are blocked, psychology systems generate mechanically equivalent alternatives that maintain Subject personality, fixation satisfaction, and encounter progression without requiring predetermined substitute content libraries.

**Minimal Player Disruption:** Consent integration operates transparently within encounter processing without requiring real-time player decisions or interrupting encounter flow with consent confirmation prompts.

**Genre Framework Preservation:** Content modification maintains cosmic horror themes and supernatural predation dynamics while accommodating individual player comfort preferences within established thematic boundaries.

### **Two-Tier Consent Architecture**

#### **Tier 1: Baseline Genre Consent**
**Implied Consent Framework:** Players downloading and engaging with "Cosmic Erotic Survival Horror" content provide implied consent for core genre elements including non-consensual supernatural predation, corruption mechanics, and dubious consent scenarios.

**Baseline Content Assumptions:**
- **Supernatural Sexual Predation:** Cosmic horror entities will sexually use player characters through supernatural influence and reality manipulation
- **Corruption Mechanics:** Character psychological and physical modification through supernatural exposure with permanent consequence potential
- **Non-Consensual Scenarios:** Characters may face scenarios where supernatural influence overrides normal consent capacity
- **Body Modification:** Supernatural transformation and physical alteration through cosmic horror entity interaction
- **Psychological Manipulation:** Mental conditioning, influence, and psychological modification through supernatural contact
- **Power Dynamic Imbalance:** Characters operate from disadvantaged position relative to cosmic horror entities with supernatural capabilities

#### **Tier 2: Specific Fetish Preference Management**
**Binary Content Flags:** Players explicitly enable or disable specific fetish content categories that extend beyond baseline cosmic horror themes into niche fetish territory requiring explicit opt-in consent.

**Tier 2 Content Categories:**

**Watersports Content:**
- **Content Description:** Urine-based fluid exchange, marking, and consumption scenarios
- **Default State:** Disabled (requires explicit player activation)
- **Alternative Generation:** Sexual fluid exchange, territorial marking through other means, intimate fluid consumption alternatives

**Vore Content:**
- **Content Description:** Consumption scenarios, predator/prey dynamics involving ingestion themes
- **Default State:** Disabled (requires explicit player activation)
- **Alternative Generation:** Dominant possession scenarios, overwhelming control dynamics, absorption metaphors

**Age Play Content:**
- **Content Description:** Age regression scenarios, adult-child roleplay dynamics, age-based power imbalance themes
- **Default State:** Disabled (requires explicit player activation)
- **Alternative Generation:** Experience-based power dynamics, mentor/student relationships, competence-based authority scenarios

**Surgical Modification Content:**
- **Content Description:** Clinical surgical procedures, medical device implantation, invasive medical modification
- **Default State:** Disabled (requires explicit player activation)
- **Alternative Generation:** Supernatural transformation processes, gradual biological modification, mystical enhancement procedures

**Marking/Branding Content:**
- **Content Description:** Permanent skin marking, branding procedures, scarification processes, ownership marking
- **Default State:** Disabled (requires explicit player activation)
- **Alternative Generation:** Temporary marking systems, supernatural sigil application, mystical binding symbols

#### **Tier 1 Intensity Management**
**Content Intensity Controls:** Core genre elements with adjustable intensity levels enabling player comfort management without removing content categories entirely.

**Pain Integration Intensity:**
- **Full Intensity:** Detailed pain descriptions, impact play scenarios, extreme discomfort elements, sadistic/masochistic themes with explicit detail
- **Moderate Intensity:** General discomfort acknowledgment, controlled pain scenarios, impact elements with reduced explicit detail, focus on power dynamics over pain specifics

**Drug/Substance Integration Intensity:**
- **Full Intensity:** Detailed intoxication effects, substance dependency scenarios, altered consciousness with explicit detail, chemical modification themes
- **Moderate Intensity:** General influence acknowledgment, supernatural alteration effects, mystical consciousness modification, reduced explicit substance references

**Intelligence Modification Intensity:**
- **Full Intensity:** Detailed cognitive regression, explicit bimbo/himbo transformation themes, intelligence reduction with detailed effects
- **Moderate Intensity:** General cognitive influence, subtle personality modification, enhanced suggestibility without explicit intelligence themes

### **Psychology Modification Framework**

#### **Subject Psychology Consent Integration**

**Pre-Processing Content Modification:** Subject psychology systems receive player content preferences during initial processing, modifying fixation expression and capability application before encounter generation begins.

**Subject Psychology Modification Process:**
```
SubjectPsychologyProcessor {
  function process_subject_psychology(
    subject_id: SubjectID,
    encounter_context: EncounterContext,
    player_preferences: ConsentPreferences
  ) -> ModifiedSubjectPsychology
  
  // Stage 1: Authentic Psychology Generation
  raw_psychology = generate_authentic_subject_psychology(subject_id, encounter_context)
  
  // Stage 2: Content Preference Integration
  modified_psychology = apply_consent_modifications(raw_psychology, player_preferences)
  
  // Stage 3: Alternative Generation
  if content_blocked(raw_psychology, player_preferences):
    alternative_psychology = generate_equivalent_alternatives(raw_psychology, player_preferences)
    return merge_psychology_alternatives(modified_psychology, alternative_psychology)
  
  return modified_psychology
}
```

**Content Modification Examples:**

**Watersports → Sexual Fluid Alternatives:**
- **Original Psychology:** Sacred Idol fixation seeks divine worship establishment through watersports fluid exchange
- **Player Preference:** Watersports disabled
- **Modified Psychology:** Sacred Idol fixation seeks divine worship establishment through sexual fluid exchange with anatomy choice presentation
- **Result:** Mechanically equivalent worship dynamics maintaining Subject authenticity with player-comfortable content expression

**Vore → Possession Alternatives:**
- **Original Psychology:** Subject seeks consumption/absorption of character through vore scenario development
- **Player Preference:** Vore disabled  
- **Modified Psychology:** Subject seeks overwhelming possession and control absorption maintaining dominance dynamics
- **Result:** Same power dynamic and Subject satisfaction through alternative expression preserving cosmic horror themes

**Pain Intensity Modification:**
- **Original Psychology:** Subject seeks extreme discomfort application with detailed impact scenarios
- **Player Preference:** Pain intensity set to Moderate
- **Modified Psychology:** Subject seeks controlled discomfort with power dynamic focus rather than explicit pain detail
- **Result:** Maintained Subject psychology and power dynamics with reduced explicit pain description

#### **Companion Psychology Consent Coordination**

**Autonomous Behavior Modification:** Companion psychology processing incorporates player content preferences while maintaining companion authenticity and independent decision-making capabilities.

**Companion Consent Integration Process:**
- **Intimate Initiative Modification:** Companion-initiated intimate encounters adapt content types and intensity based on player preference settings
- **Social Dynamic Preservation:** Relationship development and conflict resolution maintain psychological authenticity within consent boundaries
- **Cross-Companion Interaction:** Multi-companion dynamics preserve individual psychology while ensuring all interactions respect player content preferences

**Companion Modification Examples:**

**Equipment Provision Scenarios:**
- **Original Psychology:** Scholar wants player in specific equipment for research observation
- **Player Preference:** Pain intensity set to Moderate (if equipment involves discomfort)
- **Modified Psychology:** Scholar wants player in research equipment with comfort considerations for observation
- **Result:** Maintained companion psychology and relationship development with adjusted intensity approach

**Protective Response Modification:**
- **Original Psychology:** Protector responds to extreme pain scenarios with intervention
- **Player Preference:** Pain intensity Moderate
- **Modified Psychology:** Protector responds to discomfort scenarios with graduated intervention approach  
- **Result:** Consistent protective psychology with intensity-appropriate response modification

### **Technical Implementation Framework**

#### **Content Flag Processing Architecture**

**Player Preference Storage:**
```
ConsentPreferences {
  // Tier 2 Binary Flags
  watersports_enabled: boolean = false,
  vore_enabled: boolean = false,
  age_play_enabled: boolean = false,
  surgical_modification_enabled: boolean = false,
  marking_branding_enabled: boolean = false,
  
  // Tier 1 Intensity Controls
  pain_intensity: enum [moderate, full] = moderate,
  substance_intensity: enum [moderate, full] = moderate,
  intelligence_modification_intensity: enum [moderate, full] = moderate
}
```

**Content Modification Interface:**
```
ContentModificationEngine {
  function apply_consent_filter(
    psychology_output: PsychologyOutput,
    preferences: ConsentPreferences
  ) -> ModifiedPsychologyOutput
  
  function generate_content_alternatives(
    blocked_content_types: Array[ContentType],
    subject_psychology: SubjectPsychology,
    preferences: ConsentPreferences
  ) -> AlternativePsychologyOutput
  
  function validate_content_compliance(
    encounter_configuration: EncounterConfiguration,
    preferences: ConsentPreferences
  ) -> ComplianceValidation
}
```

#### **Alternative Content Generation Framework**

**Mechanically Equivalent Alternative Systems:**

**Thematic Substitution Patterns:**
- **Fluid Exchange Alternatives:** Sexual fluids, mystical essences, energy transfer, spiritual connection
- **Pain Alternatives:** Discomfort pressure, overwhelming sensation, power dynamic emphasis, control demonstration  
- **Marking Alternatives:** Temporary symbols, mystical sigils, energy bonding, spiritual claiming
- **Consumption Alternatives:** Possession dynamics, overwhelming control, energy absorption, dominant claiming

**Psychology Authenticity Preservation:**
- **Subject Fixation Satisfaction:** Alternative expressions provide equivalent psychological satisfaction for Subject fixation requirements
- **Power Dynamic Maintenance:** Content alternatives preserve established power relationships and authority dynamics
- **Relationship Progression:** Modified content enables same relationship development and progression milestones
- **Corruption Application:** Alternative content types provide equivalent corruption track progression and threshold development

#### **Cross-System Integration Requirements**

**Narrative Generation Coordination:**
Content modification effects propagate to narrative generation systems ensuring consistent content presentation throughout encounter description and choice presentation.

**Save System Integration:**
Player content preferences persist across save/load cycles with all content modifications applying consistently throughout gameplay sessions.

**Psychology System Communication:**
Content preference modifications communicate across all psychology systems (Subject, Companion, Character) ensuring consistent content treatment throughout multi-entity encounters.

### **Quality Assurance Framework**

#### **Content Modification Validation**

**Alternative Quality Assessment:**
- **Mechanical Equivalence:** Alternative content provides same mechanical benefits, progression opportunities, and consequence potential as original content
- **Thematic Consistency:** Modified content maintains cosmic horror atmosphere and Subject authenticity without jarring content substitution
- **Narrative Coherence:** Content alternatives integrate naturally with encounter progression and character development without obvious modification indicators

**Psychology Authenticity Verification:**
- **Subject Personality Preservation:** Content modifications maintain Subject individual characteristics and alien intelligence rather than generic alternative behavior
- **Companion Consistency:** Modified companion behavior reflects authentic personality development rather than artificial content accommodation
- **Relationship Development Continuity:** Content modification enables natural relationship progression without artificial restrictions or forced alternative dynamics

#### **Player Experience Integration**

**Transparent Operation:**
Content modification operates without player awareness requiring explicit notification, maintaining immersive encounter experience while respecting established preferences.

**Consistent Application:**
Content preferences apply uniformly across all encounter types, Subject interactions, and facility areas without selective or inconsistent content treatment.

**Preference Accessibility:**
Player content preferences remain easily accessible and modifiable through settings interface without requiring encounter interruption or save system manipulation.
