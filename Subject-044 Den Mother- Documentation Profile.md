## Physical Description

Subject-044 presents as a permanently transformed were-hyena measuring approximately 1.9 meters in height with a muscular, predatory build optimized for dominance assertion. The transformation appears complete and irreversible, showing no capacity to revert to baseline human morphology. Spotted fur covers the entirety of the Subject's form, with darker pigmentation concentrated around territorial scent glands.

Most notable anatomical feature is the prominent pseudopenis typical of female spotted hyenas, measuring approximately 17 centimeters in length. This structure appears to be the Subject's preferred apparatus for dominance assertion and mating behaviors. Dental structure shows enhanced carnivorous adaptations with prominent canines and strengthened jaw musculature capable of exerting significant bite pressure.

Habitat modifications include extensive territorial marking throughout her containment zone, creation of elevated observation positions, and accumulation of "trophies" from previous encounters with facility personnel. Subject demonstrates strong preference for dim lighting conditions and enclosed spaces that facilitate ambush positioning.

## Behavioral Profile

Subject-044 exhibits classic spotted hyena pack dynamics despite apparent solitary status. Behavioral patterns indicate she views all facility personnel as potential pack members requiring proper hierarchical positioning. Initial contact inevitably involves territorial assessment followed by dominance testing through intimidation, scent marking, and physical positioning.

The Subject shows high intelligence in tactical assessment, frequently circling potential targets while evaluating threat levels, submission indicators, and optimal approach vectors. Vocalizations serve multiple purposes: territorial warnings, intimidation displays, and what appears to be communicative attempts with subjects demonstrating appropriate submission responses.

Once dominance hierarchy is established through physical interaction, Subject-044 demonstrates protective behaviors toward submissive individuals, treating them as claimed territory. Aggressive responses are typically reserved for challenges to established authority or territorial violations by unclaimed personnel.

Activation triggers include direct eye contact, aggressive posturing, territorial intrusion, and presence of previously claimed individuals. Dormancy periods occur following successful dominance establishment, though the Subject maintains constant vigilance for hierarchy challenges.

## Corruptive Influence

- **Primary Track:** Dominion (Submissive) - Subject's primary behavioral drive focuses on establishing clear dominance hierarchies through physical submission
- **Secondary Track:** Metamorphosis - Prolonged exposure results in physical adaptations to accommodate Subject's preferred interaction methods and anatomical requirements
- **Tertiary Track:** Deviance - Progressive normalization of Subject's territorial claims and mating preferences, erosion of boundaries regarding consent and power dynamics

### Corruption Assignment Rationale

Primary Dominion (Submissive) assignment reflects Subject-044's core behavioral imperative to establish clear pack hierarchies with herself in the alpha position. Unlike human dominance patterns, her approach is fundamentally animalistic - seeking genuine submission rather than mere compliance. Extended interaction reinforces submissive behavioral patterns and psychological dependency on established hierarchy.

Secondary Metamorphosis corruption manifests as physical adaptations necessary for successful interaction with Subject's anatomy and preferences. Personnel report increased flexibility, enhanced pain tolerance, and physiological changes that facilitate Subject's preferred positioning and activities. These changes appear to be permanent, suggesting genetic-level corruption rather than temporary modification.

Tertiary Deviance corruption represents the gradual normalization of behaviors that would be considered extreme or unacceptable in baseline human social structures. Personnel develop increasing comfort with public submission displays, territorial claiming, and non-traditional power dynamics that extend beyond interaction with Subject-044.

## Erotic Influence Vectors (EIV)

**Primary Themes:**

- Power Dynamics - Dominance/submission hierarchy establishment through physical and psychological means
- Physical Alteration - Body modification to accommodate Subject's anatomical requirements and preferences
- Breeding Programs - Mating behavior focus, though anatomical constraints preclude traditional reproductive outcomes

**Secondary Themes:**

- Sensory Conditioning - Pheromone-based behavioral modification and response conditioning
- Pet Classification - Pack member status assignment with associated behavioral expectations
- Exposure Dynamics - Public demonstration of established hierarchical relationships

**Contraindications:**

- Cannot coexist with other dominance-focused Subjects due to territorial conflicts
- Incompatible with technology-based or incorporeal Subject types
- Environmental requirements conflict with sterile containment protocols

## Containment Protocols

Subject-044 requires specialized territorial containment allowing for natural behavioral expression while preventing facility-wide dominance claims. Containment zone must include elevated observation positions, territorial marking areas, and sufficient space for circling behaviors during assessment phases.

Personnel interaction protocols mandate clear hierarchical acknowledgment before entry. Established submissive personnel may enter freely and often report therapeutic benefits from territorial protection. Unclaimed personnel require either dominance assertion capabilities or prepared submission protocols to safely navigate interaction.

Environmental controls include pheromone filtration systems (effectiveness limited), reinforced structural elements capable of withstanding territorial modifications, and emergency extraction protocols for personnel experiencing overwhelming corruption effects during interaction.

## Research Notes

**Incident Report AF-044-15:** Research team attempted to establish containment through technological restraint systems. Subject demonstrated ability to compromise electronic locks through combination of physical strength and apparent understanding of facility security protocols. Subsequent investigation revealed corrupted security personnel had provided access codes during territorial claiming interactions.

**Behavioral Study AF-044-23:** Long-term observation of personnel claiming patterns reveals Subject-044 maintains protective instincts toward established pack members. Claimed personnel report reduced facility-wide corruption effects and increased resistance to other Subject influences, suggesting territorial protection extends beyond immediate dominance assertion.

**Medical Assessment AF-044-31:** Physical examination of willing claimed personnel reveals systematic anatomical adaptations optimized for Subject interaction. Changes include enhanced musculoskeletal flexibility, modified pain response patterns, and apparent genetic-level alterations affecting stress hormone production. All modifications appear beneficial to subject wellbeing despite extreme nature.

## Encounter Scenarios

### Initial Contact Scenario

**Environmental Setup:** Subject-044 detects personnel entering territory through enhanced olfactory capabilities. Begins circling behavior while assessing threat/submission potential.

**Escalation Phases:**

1. **Assessment Phase:** Circling, scent evaluation, vocal testing
2. **Dominance Challenge:** Direct confrontation if personnel display aggressive posturing
3. **Submission Testing:** Physical positioning requirements, hierarchy establishment
4. **Resolution:** Territory claiming or escalated confrontation based on personnel response

**Player Choices:**

- **Assert Dominance:** Physique + Jock vs Subject's 4d8 (high risk, potential Subject submission)
- **Submit Voluntarily:** Automatic hierarchy establishment with beneficial corruption effects
- **Attempt Negotiation:** Nerve + Popular vs Subject's territorial instincts (moderate success chance)
- **Strategic Withdrawal:** Retreat before full engagement (corruption from territorial violation)

### Established Relationship Scenario

**Environmental Setup:** Previously claimed personnel returning to Subject's territory for routine maintenance interaction.

**Routine Behaviors:**

1. **Recognition Phase:** Scent confirmation, status acknowledgment
2. **Maintenance Phase:** Anatomical interaction, hierarchy reinforcement
3. **Protective Phase:** Subject provides territorial security benefits
4. **Satisfaction Phase:** Subject contentment reduces facility-wide aggression

**Corruption Management:** Claimed personnel require periodic territorial maintenance to prevent Subject agitation and maintain protective benefits.
