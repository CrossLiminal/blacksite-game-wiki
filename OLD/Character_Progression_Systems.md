## Section 2: Relationship Dependencies Framework

### 2.1 System Overview

The Relationship Dependencies Framework provides unified tracking for all character relationships, enabling meaningful social dynamics while maintaining clean mechanical integration with equipment control, corruption progression, and narrative generation systems. This system tracks relationships between all five main characters and their interactions with Subjects and facility NPCs.

#### Design Philosophy

- **KISS Principles:** Simple tracking that serves gameplay without overengineering
- **Universal Scale:** All relationships use the same 0-11 progression system with context-appropriate terminology
- **Meaningful Context:** Companion relationships drive equipment control, group dynamics, and story progression
- **Player Agency:** Relationships affect treatment and options, not access or consent requirements

**Companion Relationship Autonomy:** Companions develop relationships with each other independently through story progression and shared experiences. Player choices influence companion relationships indirectly but companions make autonomous relationship decisions based on their psychological processing and story events.

#### Core Design Principles Integration

The Relationship Dependencies Framework implements Core Design Principles 2 & 3 from the Game Design Overview, ensuring that relationship choices create meaningful consequences that persist throughout the facility experience while providing clear mechanical representation of social dynamics within the cosmic horror framework.

### 2.2 Universal Relationship Scale System

#### Relationship Categories and Terminology

**Character ↔ Character Relationships:**
- **RESENTFUL (0-2):** Active dislike, blame, tension from crisis circumstances
- **NEUTRAL (3-5):** Cautious cooperation, professional distance, situational alliance
- **COOPERATIVE (6-8):** Mutual support, trust development, willing collaboration
- **LOYAL (9-11):** Deep emotional investment, protective devotion, unconditional support

**Character ↔ Subject Relationships:**

- **ANNOYED (6-8):** Mild irritation, casual interference, opportunistic harassment
- **PASSIVE (9-11):** Largely ignoring character, minimal interaction, territorial indifference

#### Progression Mechanics

**Relationship Change Triggers:**
- **Minor events:** ±0.5-1 relationship change (daily interactions, small cooperation/conflict)
- **Significant events:** ±1-2 relationship change (important decisions, crisis cooperation, major disagreements)
- **Major story beats:** ±2-3 relationship change (life-saving actions, betrayals, corruption revelations)

**Progression Permanence:** Following "Consequences Stay Consequences" principle, all relationship changes persist throughout facility experience, creating cumulative social dynamics and long-term character development patterns.

### 2.3 Starting Relationship Matrix

#### Initial Character Relationships

**Post-Crisis Relationship Setup:** The group enters the facility following the blackmail crisis orchestrated by The Other's systematic manipulation. Starting relationships reflect the trauma and tension created by recent events while establishing the foundation for relationship development.

**Starting Relationship Values:**

|                 |  Player   |  Scholar  | Protector |Manipulator|  Analyst  |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Player**      | —         | 4 (Neut.) | 4 (Neut.) | 3 (Neut.) | 3 (Neut.) |
| **Scholar**     | 4 (Neut.) | —         | 6 (Coop.) | 0 (Rsnt.) | 3 (Neut.) |
| **Protector**   | 3 (Neut.) | 6 (Coop.) | —         | 1 (Rsnt.) | 2 (Rsnt.) |
| **Manipulator** | 3 (Neut.) | 3 (Neut.) | 3 (Neut.) | —         | 4 (Neut.) |
| **Analyst**     | 4 (Neut.) | 4 (Neut.) | 4 (Neut.) | 4 (Neut.) | —         |

#### Relationship Context

**Scholar-Protector Alliance (6/6):** Natural cooperation based on shared academic/protective instincts and mutual respect developed through crisis cooperation.

**Manipulator Isolation:** Universally blamed for the blackmail crisis, creating resentment from Scholar (0) and Protector (1) while maintaining minimal working relationships with others.

**Player Integration:** Brought along by Scholar's request, maintaining cautious but functional relationships with all companions while trust develops through shared experience.

**Analyst Neutrality:** Digital entity maintaining professional helpfulness while relationships form through facility cooperation and technical assistance.

**Group Dynamics:** Foundation for Scholar/Protector alliance against Manipulator isolation, with Player and Analyst serving as potential mediators in group decisions.

### 2.4 Relationship Progression Integration

#### Scene-Based Relationship Modification

**Autonomous Companion Development:** Companion-to-companion relationships progress through story events and facility experiences that may not involve player participation. Companions react to each other's corruption progression, equipment choices, and facility behavior creating independent relationship dynamics.

**JSON Event Integration:** All scenes involving multiple characters include relationship modification potential based on outcome choices and character behavior. Relationship changes specified in scene JSON rather than hardcoded mechanics.

**Example Progression Scenarios:**
- **Group Decision Events:** Companions support or oppose player choices, affecting mutual relationship levels
- **Crisis Cooperation:** Shared danger creates positive relationship progression between participants
- **Resource Sharing:** Equipment or information sharing between characters improves mutual trust
- **Corruption Responses:** Character reactions to corruption events affect relationship development patterns

#### Relationship Development Patterns

**Positive Progression Drivers:**
- Mutual support during facility challenges and Subject encounters
- Successful cooperation in group decision-making and crisis resolution
- Equipment sharing and protective behavior between characters
- Successful facility navigation and resource management coordination

**Negative Progression Drivers:**
- Competing priorities during resource allocation and safety decisions
- Moral disagreements over corruption acceptance and Subject interaction
- Equipment control conflicts and autonomy restriction disputes
- Perceived betrayals during encounter resolution and group coordination

### 2.5 Cross-Relationship Effects

#### Emergent Scenario Creation

**Independent Group Dynamics:** Companion relationships affect group decision-making and cooperation even when player is not present. Strong companion alliances can override player suggestions, while companion conflicts create group tension requiring player mediation or acceptance of companion autonomy.

**Relationship State Combinations:** The interaction between different relationship levels creates emergent story scenarios and group dynamics without requiring systematic enumeration of all possible combinations.

**Tension Dynamics:**
- **Competing Loyalties:** Scholar LOYAL to Player + Scholar RESENTFUL toward Manipulator = Scholar seeks Player support against Manipulator
- **Protection Conflicts:** Protector LOYAL to Scholar + Player NEUTRAL toward Scholar = Protector questions Player's commitment to group safety
- **Authority Disputes:** Multiple characters COOPERATIVE with each other + RESENTFUL toward leader = potential group leadership challenges

**Alliance Patterns:**
- **United Opposition:** Multiple characters RESENTFUL toward same target = coordinated resistance or exclusion behavior
- **Mutual Support:** Characters with COOPERATIVE/LOYAL relationships = shared resources, coordinated decision-making, protective behavior
- **Influence Networks:** High relationship characters gain social leverage in group decisions through relationship-based support

**Subject Targeting Effects:**
- **Vulnerability Exploitation:** Subject VENGEFUL toward character with low companion relationships = increased danger through isolation
- **Protection Dynamics:** Character TERRIFIED of Subject + companions LOYAL to character = group protective behavior and Subject avoidance
- **Corruption Vulnerability:** Character FASCINATED by Subject + companions unable to intervene = accelerated corruption progression

### 2.6 Equipment Control Integration

#### Equipment Control Mechanics

**Universal Control System:** Any character can serve as equipment controller or controlled party, with relationship dynamics determining psychological comfort development and treatment quality.

**Keyholder Consent Status:**
- **CONSENTING:** Character chooses to accept equipment control from specific controller
- **FORCED:** Equipment imposed through story events, encounter failure, or corruption consequences

**Equipment Selection Principles:**
- **Source Determines Selection:** Equipment type based on controlling entity identity and relationship context
- **Relationship Affects Treatment:** Same equipment applied differently based on controller-controlled relationship state
- **Consent Affects Psychology:** Character psychological response varies by consent status and relationship quality

#### Psychological Comfort Development

**Starting Values:** Equipment control comfort begins at 2 if the character is consenting or 0 if forced. Relationship quality affects comfort development rate, not initial psychological state.

**Progression Rate Based on Relationship:**
```
Equipment Control Comfort Progression:
- LOYAL (9-11): 24 hours → +1 comfort (maximum comfort in 5 days)
- COOPERATIVE (6-8): 36 hours → +1 comfort (maximum comfort in 7.5 days)
- NEUTRAL (3-5): 60 hours → +1 comfort (maximum comfort in 12.5 days)
- RESENTFUL (0-2): 72 hours → +1 comfort (maximum comfort in 15 days)
```

**Equipment Control Comfort Scale (0-5):**
- **0:** Active resistance to equipment control, escape-seeking behavior, constant discomfort
- **1:** Reluctant tolerance, frequent complaints, resistance to application
- **2:** Neutral acceptance, treating control as practical necessity, mild discomfort
- **3:** Comfortable compliance, finding control reassuring or beneficial, minimal resistance
- **4:** Seeking control, feeling unsettled without controller management, requesting attention
- **5:** Psychological dependency, anxiety when controllers absent, actively seeking more restrictive control

#### Cross-Character Equipment Examples

**Scholar Equipment Control:**
- **Scholar → Player (COOPERATIVE + CONSENTING):** Careful application with full explanation, regular comfort check-ins, academic justification
- **Scholar → Manipulator (RESENTFUL + FORCED):** Cold, clinical application with minimal explanation, purely functional approach
- **Protector → Scholar (LOYAL + CONSENTING):** Protective equipment application with emotional support and safety focus

**Subject Equipment Control:**
- **Any Subject → Character:** Supernatural equipment imposed according to Subject behavioral imperatives, no consideration for character comfort
- **Equipment Type:** Always determined by Subject identity and inherent nature (divine authority, reproductive requirements, etc.)
- **Application Method:** Subjects operate according to their alien logic regardless of character relationship state

**Horror Integration:** The timer system creates cosmic horror accommodation - even RESENTFUL characters slowly develop psychological comfort with equipment control through exposure and conditioning, representing systematic predation success despite emotional resistance.

### 2.7 Technical Implementation Framework

**Spread_Vector Component:** Defines how status effects propagate when Can_Spread is enabled. Available vectors include proximity spread to characters in same location, contact spread through direct physical touch, observation spread through witnessing affected character, environmental spread to all characters in affected facility area, and intimate spread through sexual contact only.

**Effect_Generation Component:** Perk framework integration enabling characters to generate status effects in others through specific interactions. Includes trigger condition specification, generated effect identification, and target tier assignment with effects always starting at Tier 1.

#### Propagation Examples

**Environmental Pheromone Exposure:** Spreads to all characters in Subject territory through proximity vector, creating group arousal pressure during territorial encounters.

**Aphrodisiac Saliva from Corruption Perk:** Character with enhanced saliva production generates aphrodisiac exposure in partners through oral contact, creating tactical considerations for intimate encounters.

**Exhibition Arousal through Observation:** Characters witnessing exhibitionist behavior receive arousal pressure through observation vector, creating group dynamic effects during exposure scenarios.

#### Propagation Mechanics

**Spread Timing:** Status effects propagate immediately when spread conditions are met, with propagated effects starting at Tier 1 regardless of source character's current effect tier.

**Resistance Integration:** Characters resist propagated effects through existing perk-based immunity, equipment protection, or corruption resistance without requiring separate propagation resistance mechanics.

**Multiple Source Stacking:** Characters can receive same status effect from multiple sources with effects stacking according to existing status effect escalation rules.

#### Character-Generated Effects

**Perk Integration:** Corruption perks, facility experience perks, and affliction perks can include Effect_Generation components enabling characters to create status effects in others through specific interactions like intimate contact or proximity exposure.

**Tactical Significance:** Characters with effect-generating perks become tactically important for intimate encounters, creating both beneficial and risky considerations for character interaction choices and relationship development.

**Autonomous Application:** Character-generated effects apply automatically when trigger conditions are met, representing permanent character modifications affecting all interactions rather than conscious character choices or control.

- **Psychology Integration:** Scholar controller identity affects psychological processing through academic framework, generating protective authority acceptance thoughts
- **Treatment Style:** Careful, explanatory application generates psychology emphasizing intellectual safety and research necessity rather than dominance

**Subject Equipment Control:**
- **Supernatural Compulsion:** Equipment application according to Subject behavioral imperatives generates psychology emphasizing alien authority and territorial obligation thoughts
- **Psychology Integration:** Subject controller identity creates psychological responses reflecting supernatural dependency and territorial relationship development
- **Treatment Style:** Alien logic application generates psychology emphasizing Subject authority acceptance regardless of character relationship preferences

**Facility Equipment Control:**
- **Clinical Procedure Focus:** Medical or administrative justification generates psychology emphasizing institutional compliance and facility integration thoughts
- **Psychology Integration:** Facility controller identity affects psychological processing through administrative framework, generating facility cooperation acceptance thoughts
- **Treatment Style:** Professional, procedural application generates psychology emphasizing facility authority and administrative compliance rather than personal relationship dynamics
