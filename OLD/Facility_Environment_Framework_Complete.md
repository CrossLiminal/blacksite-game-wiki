## System Overview

The Facility & Environment Framework provides the systematic architecture for creating facility spaces that serve both corporate hierarchy mechanics and cosmic horror spatial impossibility. This framework governs physical facility design, floor implementation templates, and the progressive breakdown of spatial reliability through The Resonance's influence.

### Design Philosophy Implementation
- **Corporate Architecture as Systematic Framework** - Standard institutional design disguises systematic predation infrastructure
- **Vertical Hierarchy Physical Implementation** - Floor quality and access represent mechanical progression system
- **Euclidean Betrayal Progression** - Spatial reliability breakdown serves cosmic horror mechanics
