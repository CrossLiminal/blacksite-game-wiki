## 1. Core Encounter System

### 1.1 System Overview

The Encounter System handles all multi-turn conflict resolution where players face cosmic horror entities, environmental challenges, and facility threats. Rather than traditional combat, encounters focus on **corruption accommodation, environmental navigation, and resource management** through the lens of cosmic horror where Subjects are supernatural forces beyond human control.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation
- **The "Good Porn Games Problem" Solution** - Encounters serve both gameplay challenge AND erotic content delivery through corruption mechanics
- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Encounter outcomes create permanent character changes rather than temporary setbacks
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear resistance options with transparent corruption consequences
- **Cosmic Horror Framework** - Subjects function as environmental forces rather than defeatable enemies

### 1.2 Core Encounter Philosophy

#### Subjects as Environmental Forces
**Subjects function as supernatural weather patterns rather than traditional enemies.** Players don't "fight" Subjects - they navigate their influence zones, survive their environmental pressure, and find ways to resolve encounters through dominance, submission, escape, or accommodation.

#### No "Defeat" Mechanics
All encounters resolve through **influence, corruption, and power dynamics** rather than violence. "Defeat" means sexual submission and corruption application, not death. "Victory" means achieving objectives while managing corruption exposure.

#### Core Meters as Resilience Pools
- **Vitality:** Physical exhaustion resistance (Zero = incapacitated, need rest)
- **Stability:** Mental breakdown resistance (Zero = panic, irrational decisions)  
- **Inhibition:** Sexual boundary resistance (Zero = compulsive submission)

Meter depletion creates **incapacitation rather than death** - characters become unable to resist or make effective choices.

### 1.3 Turn-Based Resolution Framework

#### Round Structure: Player Phase â†’ Subject Response

**Planning Phase:**
- **Player** decides Character actions for the round
- **NPC Companions** announce intended actions based on corruption level and loyalty
- **Player** can attempt to coordinate or countermand NPC actions (success depends on corruption/relationship)
- **All intended actions** visible before resolution begins

**Resolution Phase:**
- **Each Character** makes contested roll using [Attribute] + [Skillset] vs Subject/environment
- **Same dice mechanics** as single-roll Events (explosive cascading roll-and-keep)
- **Corruption modifiers** may be hidden until they trigger ("something affected your roll")
- **Success/failure outcomes** determine individual Character results

**Subject Response Phase:**
- **Subject/environment reacts** based on Character actions and success/failure patterns
- **Environmental effects continue** (ongoing meter drain, influence zone changes)
- **Behavioral patterns execute** (Subject movement, aggression changes, new obstacles)

**Encounter Continuation:**
- **Repeat cycles** until encounter resolution conditions met
- **Corruption accumulates** throughout encounter for end-of-encounter resistance choices

### 1.4 Resolution Types and Mechanics

#### Four Primary Resolution Paths
1. **Overwhelm/Dominate** - Use superior attributes/skills to make Subject submit or retreat
2. **Submit/Accommodate** - Accept corruption to resolve encounter safely through erotic participation
3. **Escape/Evade** - Get away without direct confrontation  
4. **Cooperative Resolution** - Find mutually beneficial outcomes through corruption accommodation

#### Encounter Ending Conditions
- **Objective Achievement:** Player reaches goal (escape, gather info, access area)
- **Resource Depletion:** Character incapacitation forces specific resolution
- **Voluntary Submission:** Player chooses to submit for benefits and safer resolution
- **Subject Satisfaction:** Subject gets desired corruption and allows passage

#### Corruption Application Timing
**End-of-Encounter Resistance:** Players accumulate corruption points during encounters, then choose how to distribute/resist at the end to avoid gameplay slowdown while preserving player agency.

**Resistance Choice Framework:**
- **Full Resistance:** Roll [Attribute] + [Skillset], success = minimum corruption, failure = normal + penalty
- **Partial Resistance:** Automatic 75% corruption, no additional penalties
- **Acceptance:** Full corruption + potential benefits (temporary bonuses, story options)

### 1.5 Multi-Character Coordination

#### Player Control Scope
- **Direct Control:** Player Character only
- **Coordination Attempts:** Can request/order NPC actions
- **Information Access:** Sees all NPC intended actions before resolution
- **Limited Override:** Cannot force corrupted NPCs to act against their corruption goals

#### NPC Companion Agency
**Decision Factors:**
- **Base Goals:** Escape facility safely (shared by all NPCs)
- **Corruption Goals:** Track-specific desires that override base goals at higher thresholds
- **Tactical Assessment:** Environmental threats, available options, resource status
- **Relationship Status:** Trust level with Player, loyalty degradation from corruption

**Corruption Influence on Actions:**
- **Low Corruption (1-3):** Subtle agenda pushing that could be rationalized as stress
- **Medium Corruption (4-6):** Clear patterns of corruption-driven decision making
- **High Corruption (7-10):** Open pursuit of corruption goals over team safety

#### Coordination Failure Consequences
- **Subtle Defiance:** NPC "agrees" but executes action differently than intended
- **Open Refusal:** "I think my way is better" or corruption-driven resistance
- **Active Sabotage:** Corrupted NPCs may actively work against player objectives

### 1.6 Environmental Challenge Types

#### Subject Territory Navigation
- **Influence Zones:** Areas where Subject presence creates ongoing environmental pressure
- **Environmental Pressure:** Ongoing meter drain, corruption exposure, facility system interference
- **Behavioral Pattern:** How they move, react, and modify the environment
- **Interaction Options:** Ways players can engage directly for different outcomes

#### Example: Subject-044 Cave Hag Encounter
- **Influence Zone:** Pheromone cloud causing Inhibition drain over time
- **Environmental Pressure:** Standing in cloud = steady corruption + meter damage
- **Behavioral Pattern:** Moves to block escape routes, becomes more aggressive if resisted
- **Interaction Options:** Submit voluntarily for safer passage, negotiate for information, use equipment to neutralize pheromones

### 1.7 Technical Implementation Requirements

## 2. Event System Framework

### 2.1 System Overview

The Event System handles all single-roll conflict resolution including facility exploration, environmental hazards, story interactions, and minor Subject encounters. Events use the same dice mechanics as Encounters but resolve immediately rather than through multi-turn progression.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation
- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Event outcomes create lasting changes to character state, facility access, or story progression
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear risk/reward understanding before committing to event resolution

### 2.2 Event Categories

#### Story Events
**Single-roll story moments with immediate narrative consequences**
- Character dialogue choices with skill checks
- Facility lore discovery requiring specific attributes
- Companion relationship developments
- Plot progression gates with success/failure branches

#### Environmental Events  
**Facility hazards and exploration challenges**
- Security system bypasses (Acumen + Nerd vs facility difficulty)
- Physical obstacle navigation (Physique + Jock vs environmental challenge)
- Stealth scenarios (Intuition + Rebel vs detection systems)
- Resource scavenging (varies by location and approach)

#### Random Events
**Procedural facility encounters during exploration**
- Equipment malfunctions requiring repair
- Facility automation responding to party presence
- Environmental contamination exposure
- Brief Subject territorial boundary crossings

#### Minor Subject Events
**Brief supernatural encounters that don't escalate to full Encounters**
- Passing through Subject influence zones without direct confrontation
- Discovery of Subject territorial markers or corruption evidence
- Facility personnel recordings mentioning Subject behaviors
- Corruption exposure from Subject environmental contamination

### 2.3 Event Resolution Framework

#### Single-Roll Resolution
**Core Mechanics:**
- Use same explosive cascading roll-and-keep system as Encounters
- [Attribute] + [Skillset] vs. difficulty target
- Success/failure determines immediate outcome
- No turn progression or extended resolution phases

#### Difficulty Scaling
**Target Numbers:**
- **Trivial (8):** Basic facility navigation, simple interactions

- **Moderate (12):** Facility security, complex environmental challenges
- **Hard (15):** Advanced systems, dangerous environmental hazards
- **Extreme (18):** Facility core systems, severe environmental threats

#### Multiple Character Events
**Group Events:** All characters make rolls, collective success/failure determines outcome
**Individual Events:** Single character leads, others may provide assistance bonuses
**Specialized Events:** Require specific skillset, other characters cannot meaningfully contribute

#### Escalation Triggers
**Event-to-Encounter Escalation:**
- Critical failures may trigger full Subject Encounters
- Repeated failures in Subject territory increase escalation risk
- Story events may activate dormant Subjects or facility systems
- Security breaches may activate facility defense encounters

### 2.4 Event Content Types

## 3. Narrative Generation System

### 3.1 System Overview

The Narrative Generation System creates dynamic explicit content through the Encounter Narrative System (ENS), using micro-template architecture and variable dictionaries to generate corruption-responsive encounters that scale with character development and relationship progression while maintaining the clinical documentation aesthetic.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation
- **The "Good Porn Games Problem" Solution** - Dynamic content generation ensures explicit material serves gameplay progression rather than existing as disconnected rewards
- **Clinical Documentation Aesthetic** - System frameworks use facility documentation voice while player experience maintains immersive second-person narrative

### 3.2 Core ENS Architecture

#### Tonal Duality Principle
The ENS operates on two distinct levels that maintain thematic consistency:

**Clinical Framework (System Level):**
- Logical structure determining encounter progression and corruption effects
- Content selection based on character state and relationship status
- Maintains facility documentation aesthetic in generation logic
- Systematic approach to sexual content categorization and application

**Player POV (Output Level):**
- Immersive second-person narrative representing character's actual experience
- Corruption influences perception and language intensity
- Clinical language transforms to corrupted perception as thresholds increase
- Immediate and personal rather than observational documentation style

#### Variable-Driven Content Generation
**Core Principle:** Write encounter frameworks once, generate variations dynamically through systematic variable substitution rather than creating separate content for every possible character/corruption state combination.

**Implementation Benefits:**
- **Development Efficiency:** Single framework generates multiple variations
- **Character Responsiveness:** Content reflects actual character development
- **Corruption Integration:** Supernatural influence affects narrative presentation
- **Systematic Scaling:** Handles character customization complexity automatically

### 3.3 Template System Framework

#### Scene/Subscene Modularity
Encounters decompose into discrete scene components with multiple subscene variants:

**Primary Scene Structure:**
- **Environmental Setup:** Territory establishment, pheromone exposure, corruption pressure
- **Initial Contact:** Subject approach, relationship acknowledgment, encounter initiation
- **Escalation Phase:** Corruption application, physical interaction, power dynamic establishment
- **Resolution Phase:** Climax achievement, territorial satisfaction, hierarchy confirmation
- **Aftermath Integration:** Corruption integration, relationship status updates, facility impact

**Subscene Variants by Relationship Progression:**
- **First Encounter:** Full establishment sequence with discovery elements
- **Established Dynamic:** Abbreviated setup focusing on current interaction development
- **Routine Maintenance:** Efficient progression emphasizing relationship familiarity
- **Deepened Bond:** Advanced interactions unlocked by corruption thresholds and established trust

#### Micro-Template System
**Template Structure:** Each narrative element is a discrete, grammatically coherent micro-template selected and populated based on current game state.

**Example Framework:**
```
SCENE_RESOLUTION_PHASE = {
  environmental_setup: ENV_TEMPLATE[territory_established],
  positioning_sequence: POS_TEMPLATE[dominance_assertion],
  interaction_initiation: INIT_TEMPLATE[penetration_claiming],
  progression_dynamics: PROG_TEMPLATE[corruption_activation],
  climax_resolution: CLIMAX_TEMPLATE[territorial_satisfaction],
  aftermath_integration: AFTER_TEMPLATE[hierarchy_confirmation]
}
```

**Variable Slot Integration:** Templates contain variable slots that get populated with content appropriate to current character state, corruption level, and relationship progression.

### 3.4 Content Scaling Mechanics

1. **Character State Check:** Current anatomy, corruption levels, physical modifications
2. **Relationship Status Evaluation:** Encounter history, established dynamics, routine patterns
3. **Subject Compatibility Assessment:** Character state compatibility with Subject requirements
4. **Content Filter Application:** Player consent flags modify variable selection appropriately
5. **Template Population:** Selected variables populate narrative framework creating final content

**Corruption Progression Example:**
- **Clinical:** "Subject-044's prominent pseudopenis initiates penetration according to documented behavioral patterns"
- **Mixed:** "Her thick, dominant shaft feels both overwhelming and strangely right as corruption takes hold"
- **Corrupted:** "Your alpha's perfect breeding tool claims you exactly as nature intended"

### 3.5 Subject Integration Framework

#### EIV Profile Integration
Each Subject's Erotic Influence Vector profile determines available narrative content:

**Primary Theme Variables:** Main erotic corruption methods requiring extensive variable sets

# 4. Content Management System

### 4.1 System Overview

The Content Management System implements a two-tier consent framework that separates baseline adult content from explicit opt-in content requiring specific player consent. This system ensures player agency over sexual content while maintaining thematic consistency within the cosmic horror erotic framework.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear consent control over sexual content intensity without bypassing cosmic horror themes
- **Creator Vision Priority** - Maintains authentic erotic horror experience while respecting individual boundaries

### 4.2 Two-Tier Consent Framework

#### Baseline Content (Implied Consent)
Players consent to this content by downloading and playing an explicitly adult-rated cosmic horror game. Includes:

**Standard Sexual Activities:**
- Oral, anal, vaginal penetration in various configurations
- Masturbation, mutual stimulation, orgasm control scenarios
- Basic power exchange and authority dynamics

**Cosmic Horror Erotic Themes:**
- Supernatural sexual transformation and anatomical adaptation
- Dominance/submission power hierarchies through sexual control  
- Non-consent scenarios as corruption/loss consequences
- Basic restraint and sexual positioning for supernatural entities
- Group sexual scenarios involving multiple participants
- Standard fetish content (foot worship, body worship, basic public scenarios)

**Facility-Specific Content:**
- Clinical documentation of sexual corruption effects
- Bureaucratic treatment of erotic supernatural influence
- Sexual conditioning through supernatural psychological manipulation

#### Player Consent Control System

**Hard Block Flags (Complete Avoidance):**
- **Niche Fetishes:** Watersports, vore, inflation, latex transformation, urethral manipulation
- **Sensitivity Concerns:** Incest scenarios, significant age gaps, religious blasphemy
- **Substance-Related:** Intoxication-based scenarios, substance dependency themes

**Intensity Control Flags (Minimal Consequences):**
- **Core Facility Themes:** Physical transformation severity, mind control intensity, conditioning extremes
- **Specific Transformations:** Bimbo/himbo conversion, gender modification, dollification extremes  
- **Power/Control Themes:** Degradation intensity, authority roleplay extremes, marking/branding
- **Extreme Sensation:** Pain integration, breath control, sensory deprivation

**Special Categories:**
- **Reproductive Content:** Impregnation themes, breeding program scenarios
- **Reality Alteration:** Extreme corruption scenarios that fundamentally alter character identity

### 4.3 Content Scaling Implementation

#### Baseline Content Integration
**Always Present Regardless of Flags:**
- Cosmic horror entities use sexual influence as primary corruption method
- Character corruption involves sexual boundary erosion and intimate conditioning
- Facility survival requires navigating increasingly sexual scenarios
- Subject accommodation typically involves intimate participation

#### Identity Content Integration
- **Identity transformation scenarios** respect identity_boundaries flags set during character creation
- **Forced presentation content** scales with transformation_comfort settings
- **Equipment control scenarios** adapt to forced_scenarios preferences
- **Gender modification themes** filtered by player comfort levels
- **Dysphoria/euphoria mechanics** respect identity exploration boundaries

#### Flag-Responsive Content Modification

**Hard Block Implementation:**
- **Complete Removal:** Flagged content never appears in any encounters or scenarios
- **Alternative Routing:** Encounters provide different resolution paths avoiding blocked content
- **Narrative Consistency:** Alternative content maintains cosmic horror themes without flagged elements

**Intensity Control Implementation:**
- **Threshold Scaling:** Flagged content appears but remains at lower intensity/consequence levels
- **Frequency Reduction:** Flagged themes appear less frequently with lighter treatment
- **Alternative Emphasis:** Encounters emphasize other corruption tracks when intensity flags are set

#### Dynamic Content Adaptation
**Encounter-Level Scaling:**
- Subject encounters adapt based on player flags while maintaining core supernatural influence
- Corruption effects scale intensity based on consent settings
- Alternative resolution paths available for different comfort levels

**Character Development Integration:**
- Corruption thresholds acknowledge consent flags in their progression intensity
- Character evolution paths respect player boundaries while maintaining meaningful consequences
- Companion corruption scenarios adapt to player consent configuration

### 4.4 Loss Consequence Framework

#### Cosmic Horror Consent Doctrine
**Players should expect non-consent scenarios as natural consequences of failing to accommodate cosmic horror entities.** This is standard adult game convention within cosmic horror context.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Transparent Consequences:** Players understand that encounter failure leads to sexual submission scenarios
- **Resource Confiscation:** Subject encounters may result in equipment loss, territory claiming, companion corruption
- **Corruption Application:** Failed resistance leads to enhanced corruption through sexual conditioning
- **Agency Preservation:** Players retain choice in how they approach encounters even knowing potential consequences

#### Consent vs. Character Agency
**Player consent controls content intensity, not character autonomy during encounters.**
- **Player Level:** Controls what sexual content appears in game
- **Character Level:** In-game characters may lose autonomy through corruption/encounter failure
- **Thematic Consistency:** Cosmic horror entities don't respect human consent, but players retain content control

### 4.5 Identity Integration Framework

#### Identity Boundary Respect
- **Identity transformation scenarios** respect identity_boundaries flags set during character creation
- **Forced presentation content** scales with transformation_comfort settings
- **Equipment control scenarios** adapt to forced_scenarios preferences

**Progressive Identity Modification:**
- **Mild Changes:** Subtle appearance modifications, temporary presentation changes
- **Moderate Changes:** Significant presentation shifts, equipment-driven modifications
- **Extreme Changes:** Fundamental identity restructuring, permanent transformation

**Player Control Integration:**
- **Comfort Level Scaling:** Transformation intensity respects player boundary settings
- **Alternative Pathways:** Blocked transformation content provides alternative character development
- **Narrative Consistency:** Identity changes maintain thematic coherence regardless of intensity level

#### Equipment Control Adaptation
**Agency Modification Through Equipment:**
- **Voluntary Acceptance:** Equipment chosen by player for tactical or relationship benefits
- **Imposed Equipment:** Equipment applied through encounter failure or corruption consequences
- **Graduated Control:** Equipment effects scale from minor restrictions to complete control

**Boundary Accommodation:**
- **Forced Scenario Comfort:** Equipment control respects player preferences for autonomy loss
- **Alternative Benefits:** Players uncomfortable with control loss receive equivalent benefits through other means
- **Narrative Integration:** Equipment effects maintain story consistency while respecting boundaries

### 4.6 Cross-System Integration

# 5. Cross-System Integration

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-23  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive integration framework ensuring seamless coordination between Encounter, Event, Narrative Generation, and Content Management systems while maintaining systematic consistency and performance optimization  
**Source Integration:** Cross-system dependencies extracted from Encounter System Documentation, Event System Documentation, Narrative Generation System Documentation, and Content Management System Documentation

### 5.1 Encounter-Event Escalation Framework

#### Event Failure Escalation Triggers
**Critical Failure Escalation:**
- Event critical failures (natural 1s or extreme difficulty gaps) trigger Subject encounter activation
- Repeated failures in Subject territory zones increase escalation probability
- Security breach events activate facility defense encounter scenarios
- Environmental contamination events escalate to Subject territorial claiming encounters

**Escalation Probability Mechanics:**
- **First Failure:** 10% escalation chance to Subject encounter
- **Second Failure in Territory:** 25% escalation chance with increased Subject aggression
- **Third Failure in Territory:** 50% escalation chance with Subject hunting behavior
- **Critical Security Breach:** Automatic escalation to facility system encounter

#### Environmental Setup for Encounters
**Event-to-Encounter Context Transfer:**
- Event outcomes modify encounter environmental conditions and available options
- Failed security events reduce available escape routes in subsequent encounters
- Successful facility exploration events provide tactical advantages in Subject encounters
- Environmental contamination events create ongoing meter pressure during encounters

**State Persistence:**
- Equipment damage from events affects encounter capability
- Facility access changes from events modify encounter resolution options
- Companion trust changes from events influence encounter coordination effectiveness
- Corruption accumulation from events affects encounter resistance difficulty

#### Resource Management Integration
**Cross-System Resource Tracking:**
- Events consume resources (equipment durability, facility access, companion loyalty) affecting encounter readiness
- Encounter outcomes restore or further deplete resources affecting subsequent event difficulty
- Failed encounters reduce party capability affecting event success probability
- Successful encounters may unlock resources improving event options

### 5.2 Narrative-Content Coordination

#### Content Filtering Pipeline
**Multi-Layer Filtering Process:**
1. **Template Selection:** Content Management flags filter available narrative templates
2. **Variable Filtering:** Blocked content types trigger alternative variable selection
3. **Intensity Scaling:** Player comfort settings modify variable intensity levels
4. **Alternative Routing:** Blocked primary content activates alternative narrative pathways
5. **Consistency Validation:** Final content maintains thematic integrity regardless of filtering

**Filter Coordination Logic:**
```gdscript
ContentFilterPipeline {
  assess_player_flags() -> active_restrictions
  filter_template_library(active_restrictions) -> available_templates
  select_appropriate_template(character_state, encounter_context) -> chosen_template
  filter_variable_dictionaries(active_restrictions, chosen_template) -> available_variables
  populate_template(available_variables, character_state) -> pre_filter_content
  apply_intensity_scaling(pre_filter_content, player_comfort_settings) -> final_content
}
```

#### Template Selection Logic
**Conditional Template Assessment:**
- **Primary Templates:** Full content templates for players without relevant restrictions
- **Alternative Templates:** Equivalent complexity templates avoiding blocked content types
- **Scaled Templates:** Reduced intensity versions maintaining narrative progression
- **Hybrid Templates:** Combined approaches using multiple template components

**Template Fallback Hierarchy:**
- If primary template blocked â†’ select equivalent alternative template
- If alternative unavailable â†’ scale primary template intensity down
- If scaling insufficient â†’ combine multiple partial templates
- Emergency fallback â†’ clinical documentation template with minimal explicit content

#### Consent Flag Integration
**Dynamic Content Adaptation:**
- **Real-time Filtering:** Content generation respects player flags at generation time
- **Alternative Generation:** Blocked content triggers alternative content creation maintaining encounter value
- **Consistency Maintenance:** Alternative content maintains equivalent corruption consequences and character development
- **Thematic Preservation:** Cosmic horror themes preserved regardless of content filtering configuration

### 5.3 Character State Coordination

#### Meter Integration Across Systems
**Unified Meter Effects:**
- **Events:** Apply minor meter damage (1-3 points) with no resistance options
- **Encounters:** Apply major meter damage with resistance choice framework
- **Corruption:** Meter modification through threshold effects and conditioning
- **Equipment:** Ongoing meter modification through persistent equipment effects

**Meter Recovery Coordination:**
- **Rest Events:** Restore Vitality through facility downtime and resource management
- **Stability Management:** Restoration through companion support and successful challenge completion
- **Inhibition Recovery:** Limited restoration through corruption resistance and facility progression

#### Corruption Application Consistency
**Cross-System Corruption Sources:**
- **Event Corruption:** Automatic application (1-2 points) from environmental exposure
- **Encounter Corruption:** Major application with resistance choices (3-10 points depending on Subject category)
- **Facility Corruption:** Passive application from territorial progression
- **Equipment Corruption:** Ongoing application from persistent equipment effects

**Resistance Framework Coordination:**
- **Event Corruption:** No resistance options, automatic application
- **Encounter Corruption:** Full resistance choice framework with success/failure consequences
- **Threshold Triggers:** Automatic effects activation when corruption thresholds reached
- **Cross-Track Integration:** Multiple corruption tracks affecting character state simultaneously

#### Status Effect Propagation
**System-Wide Status Integration:**
- **Event-Generated Effects:** Environmental exposure, equipment malfunction, injury
- **Encounter-Generated Effects:** Subject influence, corruption conditioning, equipment acquisition
- **Corruption-Generated Effects:** Threshold activation, conditioning progression, addiction development
- **Equipment-Generated Effects:** Persistent modification, arousal management, agency restriction

**Effect Duration Management:**
- **Temporary Effects:** Scene-specific modifications lasting single encounter/event
- **Short-term Effects:** Multi-scene effects lasting facility exploration session
- **Long-term Effects:** Persistent effects lasting multiple facility sessions
- **Permanent Effects:** Character modifications requiring specific removal conditions

### 5.4 Technical Integration Requirements

#### Unified Save System Architecture
**Comprehensive State Persistence:**
```gdscript
UnifiedSaveSystem {
  character_state: {
    core_meters: {vitality, stability, inhibition},
    corruption_tracks: {track_type: current_points},
    equipment_state: {persistent_equipment, scene_equipment},
    status_effects: {effect_type: duration_remaining},
    relationship_status: {companion_id: relationship_data}
  },
  
  facility_state: {
    floor_progress: current_facility_level,
    room_access: [unlocked_room_ids],
    environmental_changes: {room_id: modification_state},
    security_status: facility_alert_level,
    subject_activation: {subject_id: activation_state}
  },
  
  system_progression: {
    event_history: [completed_event_ids],
    encounter_history: [encounter_resolution_data],
    corruption_threshold_unlocks: [available_threshold_levels],
    content_history: [generated_content_variations],
    escalation_tracking: {territory_id: failure_count}
  }
}
```
