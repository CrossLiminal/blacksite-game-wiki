## Section 1: Core Character Mechanics

### 1.1 System Overview

The Core Character Mechanics provide the mechanical foundation for representing player characters and companions as they navigate facility corruption. Characters use an RPG-style framework with **Core Meters**, **Attributes**, and **Skillsets** that interact through the Explosive Cascading Roll-and-Keep dice system.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Character development is permanent and cumulative
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear mechanical representation of character capabilities and limitations
- **Cosmic Horror Framework** - Human characters are fundamentally outmatched by supernatural forces, mechanics reflect this reality

#### Core Design Principles Integration

The Character System implements Core Design Principles 2 & 3 from the Game Design Overview, ensuring that player choices create meaningful consequences that persist throughout the facility experience while maintaining clear representation of character capabilities and limitations within the cosmic horror framework.

### 1.2 Core Meters (Damage/Resilience System)

Core meters represent character resilience pools rather than traditional health. **Zero = incapacitation requiring assistance, not death.**

#### Meter Calculation Formula
**Base Meter Value = Sum of (Attribute × Weight) + Sum of (Skillset Level × Weight)**

#### Damage vs Penalties

**Meter Damage:** Permanent reduction to current meter value requiring active recovery (rest, medical treatment, companion support)

**Meter Penalties:** Temporary reductions from ongoing conditions (equipment strain, arousal pressure, etc.) that resolve when the condition ends

#### Meter Definitions

##### Vitality (Physical Resilience)
- **Function:** Resistance to physical exhaustion, injury, and bodily harm
- **Zero State:** Physical incapacitation - unable to perform strenuous actions, requires rest or medical attention
- **Effect Sources:** Combat injuries, environmental hazards, physical strain, facility dangers
- **Recovery Methods:** Rest periods, medical items, facility medical resources, companion assistance

**Calculation:**
- **Attribute Weights:** Physique ×5, Nerve ×2, Acumen ×1, Intuition ×2
- **Skillset Weights:** Jock (level) ×3, Loner (level) ×2, Nerd (level) ×1, Popular (level) ×1, Rebel (level) ×1

**Example:** Physique 4, Nerve 3, Acumen 2, Intuition 3, Jock level 1
- Vitality = (4×5) + (3×2) + (2×1) + (3×2) + (1×3) = 20 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = **37**

##### Stability (Mental Resilience)
- **Function:** Resistance to psychological trauma, horror, and mental breakdown
- **Zero State:** Panic/irrationality - unable to make strategic decisions, requires companion guidance
- **Effect Sources:** Horror encounters, psychological pressure, facility atmosphere, corruption revelation
- **Recovery Methods:** Companion support, safe spaces, therapeutic activities, corruption accommodation

**Calculation:**
- **Attribute Weights:** Acumen ×5, Nerve ×2, Intuition ×2, Physique ×1
- **Skillset Weights:** Nerd (level) ×3, Popular (level) ×2, Jock (level) ×1, Loner (level) ×1, Rebel (level) ×1

**Example:** Physique 4, Nerve 3, Acumen 2, Intuition 3, Nerd level 0
- Stability = (2×5) + (3×2) + (3×2) + (4×1) + (0×3) = 10 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 0 = **26**

##### Inhibition (Sexual/Psychological Boundaries)
- **Function:** Resistance to erotic corruption, sexual coercion, and boundary erosion
- **Zero State:** Compulsive submission - unable to resist sexual scenarios, automatically accepts erotic corruption
- **Effect Sources:** Subject encounters, erotic corruption effects, sexual stimulation, arousal pressure
- **Recovery Methods:** Time away from erotic stimulation, willpower exercises, sexual relief, corruption accommodation

**Calculation:**
- **Attribute Weights:** Nerve ×4, Intuition ×3, Physique ×2, Acumen ×1
- **Skillset Weights:** Rebel (level) ×3, Popular (level) ×2, Jock (level) ×1, Nerd (level) ×1, Loner (level) ×1

**Example:** Physique 4, Nerve 3, Acumen 2, Intuition 3, Rebel level 0
- Inhibition = (3×4) + (3×3) + (4×2) + (2×1) + (0×3) = 12 + 9 + 8 + 2 + 0 = **31**

### 1.3 Attributes (Dice Pool Determination)

Attributes determine how many dice are rolled for any given action. Range: 2 (Deficient) → 6 (Peak Human), with supernatural corruption enabling progression beyond human limits.

#### Attribute Scale
- **2 - Deficient:** Below average capability, noticeable limitation
- **3 - Baseline:** Typical human standard, unremarkable
- **4 - Adequate:** Above average, naturally competent
- **5 - Superior:** Exceptional human capability, top percentile
- **6 - Peak Human:** Absolute maximum natural human potential
- **7+ - Aberrant:** Supernatural enhancement, beyond mortal limits

#### Four Core Attributes

### 1.5 Character Tier System

#### Overview

Character Tier represents facility experience and survival capability development. Tier determines how many dice a character keeps from their dice pool when resolving actions, scaling from facility newcomers to transcendent beings.

#### Tier Progression Scale

- **Tier 1** (Keep 2 dice): B3, B2 floors - facility newcomers
- **Tier 2** (Keep 3 dice): B1, Ground floors - facility experienced  
- **Tier 3** (Keep 4 dice): B4, B5, B6 floors - deep facility veterans
- **Tier 4** (Keep 5 dice): B7, B8, B9 floors - supernatural integration
- **Tier 5** (Keep 6 dice): B10+ floors - transcendent capability
- **Final Tier** (Keep 7 dice): Endgame floors - more than human

#### Tier Advancement

##### Advancement Triggers
**Story Milestone Progression:** Major story progression milestones (approximately every 2-3 facility floors)

**Floor Completion:** Tier progression tied to specific floor completion (B2, G, B6, etc.)

##### Advancement Benefits
**Mechanical Benefits:** +1 Attribute (player choice) + +2 Skillset Levels (player choice) + +1 Keep Dice

**Attribute Limits:** Cannot exceed Peak Human (6) through tier advancement alone (subject to change for Final Tier)

**Skillset Flexibility:** Can distribute skillset levels across any skillsets, enabling specialization or diversification based on facility experience

##### Advancement Philosophy

**Advancement as Character Corruption:** Character progression represents adaptation to facility environment rather than traditional heroic improvement. Enhanced capabilities come through accommodation to cosmic horror influences, relationship dependency development, and systematic compromise of original human nature.

**Story Integration:** Tier advancement represents facility experience and survival capability development, with all advancement requiring story context and facility experience validation.

**Grinding Prevention:** Story gating ensures advancement feels earned rather than mechanically optimal.

### 1.6 Explosive Cascading Roll-and-Keep Dice System

#### Philosophy
"Blind luck can win the day" - weak characters can achieve legendary results through favorable dice cascades while maintaining realistic power scaling.

#### Core Resolution Process

1. **Roll Dice Pool:** [Attribute value] dice of [Skillset die size]
2. **Explosive Cascading:** Any maximum result explodes (reroll) AND steps up one die size (d4→d6→d8→d10→d12→d12), then add results together
3. **No Cascade Limits:** Rule of Cool - explosions can continue indefinitely
4. **Keep Results:** Keep [Tier] highest dice for final result

#### Example Resolution

Character: Physique 3, Jock d6, Tier 2

- **Roll:** 3d6
- **Results:** 4, 6, 6
- **Cascading:** Both 6s explode, stepping up to d8s → roll 7, 3 on the d8s
- **Final Pool:** 4, (6+7)=13, (6+3)=9
- **Keep 3:** 13, 9, 4 = 26 total

#### Modifier Integration

**Positive Modifiers:**
- Equipment/Perk/Etc bonuses (+1 die, +1 die size, +1 keep)
- Favorable circumstances (environmental advantages)
- Beneficial corruption effects (supernatural enhancement)

**Negative Modifiers:**
- Damaged equipment, hostile environment (-1 die, -1 die size)
- Time pressure, distraction (-1 keep)
- Detrimental corruption effects (supernatural interference)

**Minimum Resolution:** Always roll at least 1d4, regardless of penalties

#### Universal Application Principle

**Any Attribute can pair with Any Skillset** depending on the specific task:
- Physique + Popular = Physical intimidation through social presence
- Acumen + Jock = Tactical analysis of physical challenges
- Intuition + Nerd = Technical work guided by supernatural sensitivity

#### Difficulty Thresholds
To serve as examples, not to be taken directly. Subjects, Traps, etc all roll their own dice vs the Player and whoever is higher wins.

- **Trivial (5):** Basic tasks under normal conditions
- **Easy (10):** Standard professional tasks
- **Moderate (15):** Challenging professional tasks
- **Hard (20):** Expert-level challenges
- **Extreme (25):** Near-impossible tasks requiring exceptional capability

### 1.7 Technical Implementation Framework

#### System Dependencies

##### Cross-System Integration Points

- **Player State Integration:** Core mechanics serve as foundation for all Player State component modifications
- **Status Effects:** Temporary modifiers affect dice pools and meter penalties
- **Equipment Framework:** Tools provide dice bonuses and meter modifications
- **Corruption System:** Supernatural influence modifies attributes, meters, and dice mechanics

## Section 2: Character State Framework

### 2.1: System Overview

The Character State Framework provides the unified foundation for all character mechanics, integrating anatomy, identity, arousal, agency, corruption, and psychological integration into one interconnected system. All encounter resolution, corruption effects, narrative generation, and Subject interactions reference character state to determine available options and content scaling for every character in the party.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

**The "Good Porn Games Problem" Solution** - All erotic mechanics serve tactical gameplay through interconnected state management for every character, ensuring explicit content integrates with rather than interrupts strategic decision-making.

**Consequences Stay Consequences** - Character state changes create permanent modifications affecting all future interactions across the entire party, with individual character development creating emergent group dynamics.

**Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Equipment and corruption choices create strategic trade-offs with clear mechanical implications across all character systems, while companion state changes affect available group options and tactical capabilities.

#### Universal Character State Architecture

**Character State Framework Universality:**
Every character in the facility - player, Scholar, Protector, Analyst, and Manipulator - maintains complete character state tracking through six core components that systematically affect each other:

- **Anatomy Profile:** Physical characteristics and corruption modifications affecting encounter compatibility and equipment fit
- **Identity Alignment:** Gender identity and presentation comfort influencing decision-making capability and psychological state  
- **Arousal State:** Current arousal levels, pressure accumulation, and conditioning effects affecting choice quality and corruption vulnerability
- **Agency Profile:** Current capability restrictions across mobility, speech, manual, vision, hearing, and decision categories
- **Corruption State:** Supernatural influence tracking across seven distinct corruption tracks affecting all other character components
- **Psychological Integration:** Derived psychological metrics calculated from all other character state components affecting encounter priorities and decision patterns

**Component Integration Principle:** Character psychology serves as the integration layer that processes anatomy, identity, arousal, agency, corruption, relationship dependencies, and equipment control comfort into derived psychological metrics. These metrics then affect all other systems, creating emergent gameplay through meaningful component interaction and unified state management across all party members.

#### Character-Specific Implementation

**Player Character:**
Complete player control over state development through choice consequences and equipment decisions. Player character state serves as primary interface for facility navigation and Subject interaction while being influenced by companion state changes.

**Companion Characters:**
Autonomous character development through story progression and facility experience. Companion states develop according to their established personality frameworks while responding to player choices and facility corruption exposure. Companion state changes affect available group actions and create dynamic party management challenges.

**Cross-Character State Interactions:**
Character states influence each other through proximity effects, shared experiences, and relationship dynamics. High arousal in one character may affect group decision-making. Identity crises create support opportunities. Agency restrictions may require other characters to provide assistance.

#### Framework Benefits

**Emergent Group Dynamics:** Complex party interactions emerge naturally from individual character state combinations without requiring predetermined scenario scripting.

**Scalable Content:** Single content framework generates appropriate variations for any combination of character states, enabling efficient development while maintaining character-specific authenticity.

**Systematic Progression:** Character development follows logical patterns driven by facility experience and cosmic horror influence, creating predictable yet varied character arc progression.

**Unified Development:** All character mechanics use the same foundational systems, enabling consistent balance and streamlined content creation across player and companion development.

### 2.2: Anatomy Profile Component

#### Design Philosophy

The Anatomy Profile tracks each character's current physical state, including baseline human characteristics and all applied corruption modifications. This serves as the foundation for encounter mechanics, equipment compatibility, Subject interactions, and content generation throughout facility progression for every character in the party.

**Universal Application:** Every character maintains complete anatomy tracking - player characters through customization choices, companions through story progression and corruption effects.

**Corruption Integration:** Anatomy profiles reflect current modified state rather than baseline human characteristics. Corruption modifications permanently alter character anatomy and unlock new interaction possibilities.

---

### 2.3: Identity Alignment Component

#### Design Philosophy

The Identity Alignment Component tracks gender identity, presentation comfort, and the critical distinction between chosen and forced presentation changes. This system preserves character agency over core identity while enabling meaningful presentation-based gameplay mechanics and authentic dysphoria representation within cosmic horror themes.

**Identity Protection with Consequences:** Characters maintain control over core gender identity through active management and attention to warning signs. Sustained neglect or active pursuit of identity-threatening choices can lead to permanent identity changes, but multiple intervention opportunities exist before reaching that point.

**Respectful Dysphoria Mechanics:** Forced presentation creates authentic discomfort that affects gameplay mechanics. The horror emerges from loss of control over presentation and gradual comfort adaptation, not from trivializing or exploiting gender dysphoria.

#### Core Identity Framework

##### Identity vs Expression vs Comfort
**Core Identity:** Fundamental gender identity - who the character truly is
- Player characters: Controlled by player choice and protected with active management
- Companions: Autonomous development through story progression and self-discovery

**Gender Expression:** How the character presents to the world
- Can be modified through equipment, corruption, or environmental pressure
- May diverge from core identity creating discomfort and gameplay consequences

**Presentation Comfort:** How the character feels about the gap between identity and expression
- Affects decision-making capability, confidence, and psychological state
- Can adapt over time through exposure, creating warning signs for identity pressure

##### Identity Stability and Warning Systems

**Identity Stability Tracking:**
- **Stable (5):** Core identity secure, clear self-knowledge, presentation alignment comfortable
- **Questioning (4):** Minor uncertainty, identity secure but presentation causing some confusion
- **Uncertain (3):** Moderate identity questioning, comfort adaptation creating self-doubt
- **Unstable (2):** Major identity uncertainty, significant comfort with forced presentation
- **Critical (1):** Severe identity crisis, character thoughts diverging from established identity
- **Dissolution (0):** Point of no return - identity changes become permanent without intervention

**Warning System Implementation:**
- **Clear indicators** when identity stability drops below safe levels
- **Multiple intervention opportunities** through equipment removal, companion support, facility choices
- **Character thought divergence** becomes visible to player as warning sign
- **Graduated consequences** allowing players to recognize and address identity pressure before permanent changes

#### Identity Components

##### Core Identity Elements
**Gender Identity:**
- **Primary Identity:** Core gender self-concept (male, female, non-binary, fluid, other)
- **Identity Confidence:** How secure the character feels in their gender identity
- **Identity Flexibility:** Natural openness to identity exploration vs rigid identity structure

**Gender Expression Preferences:**
- **Preferred Presentation:** How the character chooses to present when free to do so
- **Expression Range:** Acceptable presentation variation while maintaining comfort
- **Presentation Priorities:** Which aspects of presentation matter most for identity comfort

##### Voice and Communication
**Voice Identity Alignment:**
- How current voice characteristics (tracked in anatomy) align with identity presentation needs
- Voice training progress and identity satisfaction with vocal characteristics
- Impact of corruption-induced voice changes on identity comfort

**Communication Style:**
- **Preferred Pronouns:** How the character wishes to be addressed
- **Name Preferences:** Given name, chosen name, or other identity markers
- **Social Recognition:** How others perceive and address the character's identity

##### Presentation Adaptation
**Comfort Calculation:**
- **Base Comfort:** Natural comfort with current presentation
- **Adaptation Factor:** How quickly character adjusts to presentation changes
- **Identity Anchoring:** Resistance to presentation-based identity pressure
- **Support Modifiers:** How companion validation affects presentation comfort

**Adaptation Warning Signs:**
- **Comfort with Forced Presentation:** Finding restricted clothing less distressing over time
- **Expression Preference Shifts:** Beginning to prefer previously uncomfortable presentations
- **Identity Questioning Thoughts:** Character thoughts about "maybe I like this" or "am I really..."
- **Pronoun Comfort Changes:** Reduced discomfort with incorrect pronouns or titles

#### Character-Specific Identity Implementation

**Player Character:**
Player maintains control over core identity with clear warning systems for identity pressure. Corruption effects create presentation pressure and comfort adaptation but identity changes require sustained neglect of warning signs or active player choice to pursue identity transformation.

**Scholar (Companion):**
Academic identity with religious background creating complex relationships with authority, knowledge, and moral presentation. Identity development through intellectual framework and research rationalization of changes.

**Protector (Companion):**
Protective role identity deeply connected to capability and strength. Identity security tied to ability to protect others, creating vulnerability when physical capability or protective role is compromised.

**Analyst (Companion):**
Digital entity exploring physical identity through embodiment choice. Unique identity development from non-physical to physical existence, experimenting with gender expression and physical presentation.

**Manipulator (Companion):**
Control-based identity with social positioning and influence as core components. Identity security tied to maintaining control over social dynamics and personal presentation choices.

#### Identity Development Mechanics

##### Companion Identity Progression
**Autonomous Development:** Companions develop identity through story progression, facility experience, and corruption exposure based on their personality frameworks and established patterns.

**Player Influence:** High-trust companions may seek player advice on identity questions, with player input influencing but not controlling companion identity development decisions.

**Cross-Character Support:** Companions can provide identity validation and support for each other, affecting identity stability and comfort calculations across the party.

##### Identity Crisis Management
**Crisis Triggers:**
- Sustained forced presentation creating comfort adaptation
- Corruption effects causing identity questioning thoughts
- Equipment control creating dependency on others for presentation choices
- Facility pressure requiring identity concealment or modification

**Intervention Options:**
- Equipment removal or modification to restore presentation control
- Companion support and validation to reinforce identity stability
- Facility choices that prioritize identity comfort over tactical advantages
- Active resistance to corruption effects targeting identity systems

#### Cross-System Integration

**Anatomy Integration:** Physical characteristics affect presentation options and identity comfort calculations through body image and capability alignment.

**Equipment Effects:** Locked clothing and control equipment can force presentation changes creating discomfort and identity pressure over time.

**Arousal Integration:** Identity comfort affects arousal patterns, with dysphoria reducing arousal effectiveness and euphoria enhancing arousal building.

**Agency Impact:** Identity uncertainty reduces decision-making confidence, while secure identity enhances decision agency and social capability.

**Corruption Vulnerability:** Identity stability affects resistance to corruption tracks targeting self-concept, with unstable identity creating increased vulnerability to Efface, Enthrall, and Deviance effects.

**Relationship Effects:** Identity presentation and comfort affect companion relationships and social interactions throughout facility progression.

### 2.4: Arousal State Component

#### Design Philosophy

The Arousal State Component tracks psychological arousal and pressure accumulation for all characters, driving tactical gameplay through arousal management while serving explicit content delivery through meaningful game mechanics. This system operates independently from anatomical sensitivity, allowing for complex character development and corruption effects.

**Universal Application:** Every character tracks arousal state through autonomous development based on their experiences, personality patterns, and corruption exposure.

**Mental vs Physical Separation:** Psychological arousal tendency operates independently from anatomical sensitivity, enabling sophisticated character development where mental arousal patterns can diverge from physical responsiveness.

#### Core Arousal Framework

##### Arousal Calculation System
**Current Arousal (0-10):** Calculated output representing immediate mental arousal intensity
- **0-2:** Clear thinking, optimal decision-making capability
- **3-5:** Mild arousal, slight decision-making bias toward relief seeking
- **6-7:** High arousal, noticeable impact on resistance effectiveness and inhibition
- **8-10:** Extreme arousal, compulsive relief seeking, encounter choice bias

**Base Horniness (1-5):** Natural arousal tendency before external pressure
- **1:** Very Low - difficult to arouse, requires significant stimulation
- **2:** Low - below average responsiveness to arousal situations
- **3:** Average - typical arousal building patterns
- **4:** High - easily aroused, responds strongly to arousal situations
- **5:** Extreme - overwhelming arousal tendency, rapid arousal building

**Calculation Framework:** Current Arousal = Base Horniness + Active Pressure Sources (capped at 10)
- **Note:** The math here is only to serve as a conceptual example. Not the actual calculation.

##### Pressure Source Categories

**Physical Pressure Sources:**
- **Denial/Restriction:** Equipment or situations preventing arousal relief
- **Heat/Rut Cycles:** Corruption-induced fertility periods creating arousal spikes
- **Pheromone Exposure:** Subject territories, other characters, environmental contamination
- **Equipment Stimulation:** Ongoing stimulation from worn equipment without relief opportunity

**Psychological Pressure Sources:**
- **Identity Dynamics:** Presentation changes creating arousal through comfort/discomfort responses
- **Power Dynamics:** Control situations, dominance/submission scenarios, authority interactions
- **Relationship Tension:** Sexual chemistry, emotional intimacy, interpersonal arousal
- **Forbidden Situations:** Taboo scenarios increasing psychological arousal pressure

**Environmental Pressure Sources:**
- **Subject Territorial Exposure:** Supernatural influence creating arousal pressure in Subject areas
- **Facility Corruption:** Environmental contamination affecting arousal baseline
- **Group Dynamics:** Observed arousal in other characters creating arousal contagion effects
- **Conditioning Triggers:** Repeated exposure to situations creating learned arousal response patterns

**Status Effect Pressure:**
- Any active status effect listing "arousal pressure" as a component effect

#### Gameplay Effects and Integration

##### Decision-Making Impact
**Arousal Threshold Effects:**
- **Low Arousal (0-3):** Clear decision-making, effective corruption resistance, tactical thinking
- **Moderate Arousal (4-6):** Slight bias toward relief opportunities, reduced inhibition effectiveness
- **High Arousal (7-8):** Significant decision-making impairment, strong relief seeking, corruption vulnerability
- **Extreme Arousal (9-10):** Compulsive behavior, automatic relief prioritization, severe corruption susceptibility

##### Cross-System Integration
**Inhibition Meter Effects:** High arousal creates ongoing pressure on Inhibition meter, with extreme arousal causing inhibition damage over time.

**Agency Interaction:** Extreme arousal reduces decision agency through compulsive behavior and choice filtering toward relief opportunities.

**Identity Integration:** Identity comfort affects arousal patterns, with dysphoria reducing arousal effectiveness and euphoria enhancing arousal building rates.

**Corruption Vulnerability:** High arousal increases susceptibility to corruption offers and supernatural influence through reduced resistance capability.

#### Arousal Relief Framework

**Relief Mechanisms (Examples):**
- **Sexual Release:** Direct orgasm provides immediate arousal reduction and pressure relief
- **Equipment Removal:** Ending restrictive or stimulating equipment reduces ongoing pressure sources
- **Time Passage:** Natural arousal reduction through extended periods without stimulation
- **Environmental Changes:** Leaving high-pressure areas (Subject territories, contaminated zones)

**Relief Effectiveness:** Different relief methods provide varying arousal reduction, with some methods creating temporary satisfaction while others provide lasting pressure management.

#### Character-Specific Arousal Implementation

**Player Character:**
Arousal develops through encounter choices, equipment decisions, and facility experiences. Player manages arousal through strategic choice-making while facing pressure from environmental and corruption sources.

**Scholar (Companion):**

### 2.5: Agency Profile Component

#### Design Philosophy

The Agency Profile Component tracks character capability restrictions across six categories using a simple 1-3 scale with narrative triggers at 0. This system creates meaningful gameplay limitations while preserving character choice within constraints, serving both tactical gameplay and psychological horror themes for all characters in the facility.

**Universal Application:** Every character tracks agency across all categories, with restrictions creating story opportunities, assistance dynamics, and relationship development rather than removing character autonomy entirely.

**Agency Philosophy:** Characters maintain meaningful choice even under restriction, with Agency 0 triggering narrative content and assistance opportunities rather than removing character control or story presence.

#### Agency Rating System

**Agency Scale:** 1-3 capability levels with clear gameplay implications
- **Agency 3:** Full capability, no restrictions or penalties
- **Agency 2:** Minor restrictions, -1 dice penalty to relevant actions, some options unavailable
- **Agency 1:** Major restrictions, -2 dice penalty to relevant actions, most options unavailable
- **Agency 0:** Narrative trigger, assistance opportunities, dependency content focus

**Restriction Philosophy:** Agency limitations create interesting tactical constraints and story development rather than punishment mechanics.

**Experience-Driven Development:** Character transformation reflects specific interactions with Metamorphosis-capable Subjects.

**Threshold Intensity:** Corruption threshold levels determine transformation extremity rather than specific changes. Level 1 creates minor modifications, Level 5 enables major anatomical reconstruction, with Subject type determining transformation direction.

##### Conflict Resolution

**Hybrid Development:** When characters encounter multiple Metamorphosis sources affecting same anatomy, features combine rather than replace. Horse genital modification combined with canine influence creates hybrid characteristics incorporating both transformation sources.

**Existing Change Stability:** Previously established transformations influence new modifications through blending rather than complete replacement, preserving corruption investment while enabling continued character development.

##### Facility Medical Integration

**Protective Injection Protocol:** Mandatory injection administered during initial B2 Medical NPC encounter provides character options for major resistance to complete anatomical inversion and minor resistance to general anatomical transformations, while permitting modification, reduction, and addition changes to maintain research subject utility.

**Medical Reversal Services:** Physical anatomical changes can be modified or reversed through facility medical procedures requiring payment, favors, or administrative approval. Psychological corruption effects and behavioral modifications remain permanent regardless of physical reversal.

**Facility Control Framework:** Medical services create dependency relationship where bodily autonomy exists through facility cooperation, with modification access subject to administrative policies and character compliance status.

#### Cross-System Integration

##### Character State Effects
**Anatomy Profile Integration:** Metamorphosis corruption directly modifies anatomical characteristics while other tracks affect anatomy comfort and presentation preferences.

**Identity Alignment Effects:** Efface corruption affects identity stability while other tracks modify identity presentation comfort and expression preferences.

- **Same situation, fundamentally different psychological experience**

**Thought Processing Inputs:**
- **Current Situation Context:** What's happening in the scene
- **Character State Data:** All tracked character information
- **Personality Framework:** Scholar's academic approach vs Protector's protective instincts
- **Corruption Influence:** How supernatural modification affects thought patterns

**Thought Output:** Authentic character internal monologue reflecting current psychological state and development progression.

###### Decision Option Filtering
**Choice Availability Modification:** Psychology enables or disables specific choice options based on character's current psychological comfort and behavioral patterns.

**Option Filtering Examples:**
- **High Corruption:** Adds compulsive choices ("I can't resist approaching the Idol")
- **Low Autonomy Development:** Removes independent options, adds guidance-seeking choices
- **Identity Conflicts:** Adds questioning/experimental options ("Maybe I should try...")
- **Relationship Dependencies:** Modifies choice framing toward relationship maintenance

**Choice Description Modification:** Same mechanical choice described differently based on psychological state.
- **Equipment Acceptance:** "Accept Scholar's helpful research restraint" vs "Submit to Scholar's divine authority"
- **Encounter Approach:** "Investigate Subject behavior" vs "Seek Subject's attention"

###### Companion Decision AI
**Autonomous Choice Calculation:** Companions evaluate available choices through psychological processing determining preference ranking based on current psychological state and personality framework.

**NPC Decision Process:**
```
Psychology evaluates each available option through:
- Character personality framework (Scholar's academic rationalization)
- Current corruption accommodation (how comfortable with supernatural)
- Relationship priorities (maintaining bonds vs pursuing individual goals)
- Identity comfort patterns (presentation and role preferences)

Returns: Highest psychological appeal option for autonomous execution
```

**Companion Consistency:** NPCs make choices that feel authentically character-driven rather than mechanically determined, creating believable character development progression.

##### Character-Specific Psychological Processing

###### Personality Framework Integration
**Same Data, Different Psychology:** Identical character state data processed through different personality frameworks creates unique psychological responses reflecting individual character identity.

**Scholar Psychological Processing:**
- **Academic Rationalization:** Corruption accommodation through research framework ("Required for comprehensive understanding")

- **Intellectual Authority:** Decision confidence through knowledge validation and academic competence

**Protector Psychological Processing:**
- **Protective Identity Focus:** All psychological responses filtered through protective capability and duty framework
- **Physical Confidence Integration:** Body image and capability affect autonomy preference and submission acceptance
- **Strength Vulnerability:** Psychological responses to situations where protection fails or strength becomes liability

**Analyst Psychological Processing:**
- **Observation Framework:** Digital entity psychology focused on data collection and analysis priorities
- **Embodiment Transition:** Physical form development affecting all psychological calculations and identity formation
- **Information Processing:** Decision-making through systematic analysis rather than emotional or instinctive responses

**Manipulator Psychological Processing:**
- **Control Dynamics Focus:** All psychological responses filtered through influence maintenance and social positioning
- **Power Inversion Anxiety:** Psychological responses to situations where control dynamics reverse
- **Strategic Assessment:** Decision-making through outcome prediction and tactical advantage calculation

##### Grateful Horror Recognition Framework

###### Correlated Psychological Progression
**Grateful Horror Detection:** Recognized through simultaneous positive psychological responses across multiple character state areas despite objectively controlling or restrictive circumstances.

**Recognition Pattern:**
- **Identity Comfort:** Psychological processing shows increasing comfort with forced presentation changes
- **Relationship Satisfaction:** Psychological responses show positive bond development despite control dynamics
- **Corruption Accommodation:** Psychological acceptance increasing alongside other comfort metrics
- **Equipment Acceptance:** Psychological comfort with control exceeding baseline autonomy preferences

**Multi-System Correlation:** Grateful horror emerges when psychological processing shows positive responses across identity, relationships, corruption, and equipment simultaneously rather than single-area progression.

##### Cross-System Integration Applications

###### Narrative System Integration
**Voice Consistency:** Psychology ensures character thoughts and internal voice remain consistent with current psychological state across all narrative content.

**Content Adaptation:** Psychology processing affects narrative template selection ensuring content reflects authentic character psychological development.

###### Event System Integration
**Choice Presentation:** Psychology modifies how identical mechanical choices are described and framed for character authenticity.

**Option Availability:** Psychology enables situation-appropriate choices and disables psychologically inconsistent options.

Implementation prioritizes modular design enabling independent component development while maintaining seamless character state coordination.

**Universal Character Architecture:** Technical framework supports identical character state tracking for player characters and companions while enabling different control interfaces and development patterns.

**Development Philosophy:** Clean separation between game logic and technical implementation enables content creation focus while maintaining system reliability and performance across multiple character management.

#### Multi-Character State Management

**Character State Container Architecture:**
```gdscript
class CharacterStateManager:
    var character_states: Dictionary = {}  # character_id: CharacterState
    var psychology_processors: Dictionary = {}  # character_id: CharacterPsychology
    
    func update_character_state(character_id: String, component: String, value):
        var state = character_states[character_id]
        state.update_component(component, value)
        
        # Trigger psychological recalculation
        psychology_processors[character_id].invalidate_cache()
        
        # Check for cross-character state effects
        propagate_state_effects(character_id, component, value)
    
    func get_character_psychology(character_id: String):
        return psychology_processors[character_id]
    
    func propagate_state_effects(source_id: String, component: String, value):
        # Handle cross-character effects like arousal contagion, corruption influence
        for other_id in character_states:
            if other_id != source_id:
                apply_cross_character_effect(source_id, other_id, component, value)
```

**Individual Character State Structure:**
```gdscript

## Section 3. Character Creation Framework

### 3.1 System Overview

The Character Creation Framework provides structured archetype selection for both player characters and NPCs, ensuring consistent character builds while offering meaningful choice differentiation. Characters are created through archetype selection rather than point-buy systems, maintaining thematic consistency with the "high school survivors" premise.

#### Design Philosophy Implementation

- **Consequences Stay Consequences** - Archetype choice creates permanent character strengths and vulnerabilities
- **Player Agency Through Meaningful Choices** - Clear trade-offs between specialized capability and specific weaknesses
